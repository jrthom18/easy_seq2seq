you might want to look at this question: how can i prevent iphoto to open everytime i plug my ipad?  the summary is that image capture has an option to change what happens when a camera is attached to the computer. 
there should be a padlock before the page title at the top of the screen when you're on an https page. 
hold down the decrease screen brightness button at the top of the keyboard, it will get dimmer and dimmer, and at the end jump to a black screen (the screen's light will actually be off)

the hdiutil command-line utility gives you more flexibility, and is extensively documented in man hdiutil
new apps are never installed to the first screen
you can download it from here : http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/  you will need to have the product key to install it
got it.  open the xml file in textedit (or some other xml editor of your choice).  scroll to the very bottom.  look for:         payloaddisplayname     orig profile     payloadidentifier     orig.profile  change these two instances orig to dup or some other unique name. save file. go to configurator > import > point to file - it imports as 'dup profile' with all other settings in tact.  (i suppose you could also make xx copies of the xml file and edit each one, but it is easier just to leave the file open in textedit, make a change, save, import, make a change, save, import, lather, rinse, repeat.) 
this should do the trick:   go to applications / utilities and open the java preferences. select the java version you're interested in. hit options and add the heap size argument, which is -xmx followed by amount of memory you want it to have
your brother's apple id probably still has his phone number associated with it for imessage

you can only manually add photos to photostream from iphoto or aperture not from the ios device currently,  so you'd need to sync with iphoto and manually add to photostream through that. 
totalterminal might be a better option
you can try whether sudo -s still works (which would allow you to add yourself to the admin group again), but probably it won't.  do the following   reboot into single user mode by keeping cmd-s pressed during reboot /sbin/mount -uw / rm /var/db/.applesetupdone reboot   this will trick your mac into behaving like a new installation (but with your data still intact)
first, click the annotations button    then click the down arrow on the signatures button    you can then select the signature you wish to use.

i was able to do what i wanted by installing karabiner and adding a file here:  $ nano ~/library/application\ support/karabiner/private.xml   i added the following:  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;    &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;custom shortcuts&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;shift + up = page up&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;custom.pageup&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__keytokey__ keycode::cursor_up, vk_shift | modifierflag::none, keycode::pageup&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;shift + down = page down&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;custom.pagedown&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__keytokey__ keycode::cursor_down, vk_shift | modifierflag::none, keycode::pagedown&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;shift + left = home&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;custom.home&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__keytokey__ keycode::cursor_left, vk_shift | modifierflag::none, keycode::home&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;shift + right = end&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;custom.end&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__keytokey__ keycode::cursor_right, vk_shift | modifierflag::none, keycode::end&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;shift + delete = forward delete&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;custom.delete&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__keytokey__ keycode::delete, vk_shift | modifierflag::none, keycode::forward_delete&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt;   i then clicked "reload xml" in karabiner and selected the new options, which took effect immediately! it seems to simulate the desired keypresses in every app.

continuity activation tool is a great app for doing all of the command-line stuff necessary to enable continuity, and it claims to be able to work with usb dongles. 
an article written by someone else who did that:    http://blog.whitehatsec.com/cracking-aes-256-dmgs-and-epic-self-pwnage/  the author did get his cracked, but had to borrow a supercomputer to do so even after he got custom software designed to use partial knowledge of the password he had chosen.  it shows how hard a general cracking effort would be, but also how choosing a short or known pass phrase makes it practical in some cases to hire an expert to bypass even a good solid encryption scheme.

you may want to try seil (formerly pckeyboardhack). i use it to bind caps lock to right-ctrl (not plain ctrl), so that i can bind caps lock to meta in emacs (while ctrl remains ctrl, and other keys are kept to the usual behavior). 
that looks like you have a chrome plug-in that is a web site reader.  on your screen shot one can see the "250wpm" (words per minute)in bottom right corner, that would be an indication that you have a reader plug installed.  remove it or fix it. 
that totally depends on the apps you want to do.  do they need gps localization? a microphone? front or back cameras? hi-res camera?  besides, you can't test an ipad app on the iphone, so you'll need an ipad no matter what.  edit: according to the comment, an ipod touch would be enough for you. 
short answer: it doesn't matter.  longer version: either will work fine

to not change the color, font size and other styling attributes : you must use classes in text suite or in extended text suite.  like this :   tell application "omnigraffle professional 4"    set somegraph to solid 1 of canvas 1 of document 1    --set word 1 of text of somegraph to "hello"   --set characters 1 thru 4 of text of somegraph to "hello"   --set attribute run 1 of text of somegraph to "hello"   set paragraph 1 of text of somegraph to "hello world" end tell

you can use the arch program to select which architecture of a universal binary to run.  if you wanted to use the 32-bit version of the executable:  arch -arch i386 /usr/bin/bc   and if you wanted the 64-bit version of the executable:  arch -arch x86_64 /usr/bin/bc   note this doesn't work with applications (folders that end in .app and have manifests and what not so os x recognizes them as applications), just universal binaries
indeed, you should use quicktime rather than imovie: imovie will import (and therefore usually encode) the movie, but will also force you to export, as you have noted.  the main interest of using quicktime is to use its editing features.  assuming you're using quicktime x (snow leopard / lion), open your movie file, and hit ⌘t (or edit > trim)

ideally, you would follow the recommendations of the wavtap developer and the airparrot developer on how to uninstall their extensions.  but there are almost certainly files related to wavtap and airparrot in the extensions folder of the library folder of the startup disk:  /library/extensions/  … which you can delete and then reboot in order to get rid of wavtap and airparrot.  there may also be files at:  /system/library/extensions  … but be very careful in there because if you delete the wrong thing you could cause your system not to be able to boot.

there are two steps involved:   change your siri voice settings to english (united kingdom) - as of ios 7.1.2 this is under settings > general > siri > language and also settings > general > international > voice control (they're both the same setting: change one and the other changes too). change your device language setting to british english: it's under settings > general > international > language.   that second one was difficult to find because the default option is english - as opposed to english (united states) which always prompts me to check for an english (united kingdom) version - and the list is not in alphabetical order: british english and australian english are both there but way down at the bottom
you are misunderstanding the way (mac)vim processes its configuration

i have run mavericks/yosemite on a 64 gb sd card and after a clean install, there was about 20-30 gb free.  i would say that you could install yosemite on a 20 gb partition, but i would not recommend anything less than 30 gb.

if you lose your phone or it is stolen, it is likely to be miles away from your home and just knowing this allows you to use the 'find my iphone' feature on www.me.com to remotely wipe (and/or kill) the phone, or to make it bleep and put up a message if you realise you've left it at your friend/family-members' house.  an sms-based app would require you to have another phone to find/lock/wipe your iphone, plus there's always the chance that you forgot to run the app following a reboot, or that it crashed.  "find my iphone" is built into ios, so you don't have to remember to run it.  although 3g does use up more battery than 2.5g or 2g, this is not the primary cause of battery drain in a smart phone - try quitting some your apps to find out which one is draining the battery.  also, read through the comments on the link you posted - there are some real unhappy users there who post about the problems

there are few places that information is available, but since kernel is multitasking beast one has to look in multiple places:   the simple one is the console log "type kernel in the filter box", but not all activity is reported there since kernel issues millions of instructions in a milli-second.  also the activity monitor is a good source of information.  you could use the ps -a &gt; process.txt to see all running processes.  you could use the sudo iosnoop to see all disk activity.  you could use kextstat &gt; ~/desktop/kexts.txt to see all loaded drivers.  in other words, it is to busy for you to follow and a continuous output file would not make senses.

using macports ( http://macports.org/ ), with insight from instructions at http://blog.hani-ibrahim.de/en/octave4-mac-os-x-el-capitan-install.html (as well as http://blog.hani-ibrahim.de/en/octave-mac-os-x-el-capitan-install.html and http://blog.hani-ibrahim.de/en/octave4-upgrade-via-macports.html) as well as the octave wiki at http://wiki.octave.org/octave_for_macos_x#macports  it seems as though macport's default atlas variant doesn't play nice with octave, and arpac and qrupdate also have issues with their default installion, needing specific "variants" to properly build
airsharing is a swiss army knife of turning any ios device into a wireless file server
you shouldn't have to continually pair the mouse after every restart, this indicates there is a problem.  first thing i would try is to power everything down, and then turn the mouse back on (small switch on the bottom) so that the mouse is "discoverable" before restarting
this icon is shown on files that have been downloaded from the internet and not used yet.  the first time you open the application, you will see a dialog warning you that you downloaded the application from the internet and asking if you are sure you want to run it. say yes and run the app, and the icon should soon be changed back to what it should be (you may need to log out and back in).    to answer your question in general:  to change an app's icon, you first need to copy the new icon you want to use to the clipboard.   open the image file you want in preview (found in your applications folder), select all (&#x2318;+a), and copy (&#x2318;+c). find the app whose icon you want to change

i love the setting where you can only sync songs with the checkbox to one or more ios devices.    simple deselect the songs by plalist, genre, or as you find them and even if they are in a playlist or genius mix that would normally install the song on your device during a sync, itunes will suppress those songs that are not check marked.

if you're comfortable opening the terminal you could run the command  locate abc/readme.txt   and it will give you the full file path to any files on your machine that are named readme.txt in a folder named abc.  while you're there you can copy and past the path as an argument to the open command and it will open it for you.  taking it one step further you can use the output of locate as the arguments for open with xargs  locate abc/readme.txt | xargs open   will open all files that have abc/readme.txt on your machine just as if you had double-clicked them. 
that should work fine.   do your full backup go into general -> reset ->reset all content and settings   this completely wipes the ios device so your friend will set it up as if it were new.  when you get it back ask him to do the same thing first, in case they set a password
direct answers to your questions…   yes - though that's it's 'masked' address not it's actual location. real location is c:\users\[myname]\music\ yes. you can dupe the library.xml file &amp; change the hard-coded paths to the new location, then import. simple, but time-consuming.   another downside to that method is that once you have separated the identities in such a way, they will remain forever separate &amp; any music added to one will also need to be added to the other. you will also have to remember to launch with the correct library every time.  however… instead, if you use 'sync selected playlists, artists, albums &amp; genres you can have completely different selections for each device, even on the same id.  i have totally different selections on my iphone &amp; ipod, as i use them for different things. might be a whole lot easier to manage.   
apple music require itunes 12.2, which is not included in yosemite 10.10.4 so, soon, apple should release another update exclusively for itunes where there should be a button to play apple music.  you can get that update from the itunes menu - select check for updates...  if that update isn't rolled out or available, you can listen here:  http://itsliveradio.apple.com/streams/hub01/session01/256k/prog.m3u8 
directly on the ipod, i don't think so, if your sound settings are maxed.  try     settings > ipod > volume limit : off   and     settings > ipod > sound check : off     on itunes, go to the "info" window of the podcast audio file, and in the option tab, try to see if you can set the audio volume to 200%
you can do things like that in matlab or the free clone octave
best i can tell, the answer is a resounding “no” — at least without deleting your itunes library .itl file. 
my presumption is that when you burned the dvd using imovie - it was encoded within a video_ts folder and you will need some software to move the video and sound files (which are hidden and obscured on the filesystem) back into a format that can be played on your mac and/or burned back to a fresh optical drive.  depending on the version of software that wrote the dvd to disc, you might be able to locate the raw video files (or find them on a backup)
if you're using itunes on windows, i think you can just use playlist sharing?  if you're looking to access a directory that's shared from windows, you'll need to find a utility for your ipad that supports samba (smb), as that's the protocol in use for file sharing on windows.

in the case of backslash \, the problem is a difference between where macintosh french keyboards put the backslash (which is &#x2325;+&#x21e7;+:), and where windows french keyboards put the backslash (which is ctrl+&#x2325;+8).  since the way remote desktop works is that scancodes, not characters, are sent to the remote system, you have to honor the windows keyboard and press ctrl+&#x2325;+8 to get a backslash.  pipe | is ctrl+&#x2325;+6  i was able to debug this using the on-screen keyboards, which both macintosh and windows support.

   can i safely remove old versions of xcode which are using a lot of space?   yes.     if i can, what should i do?   run:  sudo &lt;xcode&gt;/library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all   where &lt;xcode&gt; is usually /developer but can sometimes be ~/developer depending on whether you installed it with sudo privileges or not.  once you've run that script you can just move /developer or ~/developer to the trash, you don't need it any more.  you can can get more details about uninstalling by reading the about xcode.pdf document in your  directory.  if you also have a /developer-old directory you can just move that to the trash.

using homebrew (as requested):  $ brew tap homebrew/dupes $ brew install unzip   this will install unzip at (considering defaults) /usr/local/cellar/unzip/6.0/bin/unzip  you can then alias it as unzip6 somewhere in your path.  also, you may want to to try "the unarchiver" from the app store

one way to do it is    set your window how you would like it,  go to window > save windows as group...      enter a name next to save as: check "use window group when terminal starts" click save   however, after you have launched terminal, if you chose terminal > new window you will still have to resize the window

first thing to understand is that it is not actually a "single command", it is a single line only because it uses ';' to separate command lines rather than newlines.  so the first thing to do when attempting to understand it would be to make it more human readable by using your favourite text editor to replace ';' with a newline

once you purchased an app, you can always re-download that app free of charge, given that the following criteria are true:   the app is still offered on the app store the app is available in your country   if you moved countries and all the above is true for you, apps purchased elsewhere will be hidden, but can still be obtained by regularly searching for them.  they will state a price and you will need to go through the purchase process again, but once you entered the apple id you used to purchase the app originally, you will receive a message saying that you already own it and that the download will be free of charge.  i know that this sounds scary and i always shiver until i receive that message myself, but having moved countries myself, i can confirm that behavior and never had any problems re-downloading an app (except for sometimes finding them among the many other search results when looking for it).  one thing, however, since you mentioned aperture and iphoto

the dock indicator light does not differ between which app is in the foreground.  as a workaround, you could install a third party item called hyperdock (for eur 6.95 as of this writing) to show you the content of the window when hovering over the icon with the mouse (similar to how windows' aero desktop does).

instead of uninstalling these apps, you could just hide them.  doing this in terminal: sudo chflags hidden /applications/chess.app will hide the application from sight, but will still be there.  here is the link for the source: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20091229093051878 
there is no way to do this from the client level, but you may be able to configure something in your router.  it's usually by design that a router will maintain a listing of the mac addresses of the clients that it has handed out an ip address too, and when the timeout for the dhcp lease happens, it gives the same ip to the same mac

the answer is no, safari does not provide any built-in functionality or shortcut (to the non-existing functionality) to restore the last closed tab.  the only functionality that safari currently offers is:   reopen last closed window undo close tab (as part of the undo event chain)    the first does just that, re-opens the last closed window, including all the tabs that were open when it closed.  the second works as you already know, it only works if it's the last thing you did, or you have to undo other things which is the caveat you noted above.  looking at safari extensions, there are a few tab managers around, however none of them specifically note their support for tab undo's except safaritabs and this functionality was removed from the product for safari 5; as the developer notes that safari 5 now provides this as part of the undo chain  developing a solution for this while it's not trivial, isn't something that is going to be impossible as apple have done most of the hard work

your best bet is reverse engineering the existing transitions if you investment in time costs less than the $50 for motion which is the official tool for making custom transition effects.  look in /applications/imovie.app/contents/plugins/mediaproviders/motioneffect.fxp/contents/resources/templates.localized/transitions.localized and the transition file is simply an xml file with the .motr file extension:  $ head pan\ down\ slow.motr  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;!doctype ozxmlscene&gt; &lt;ozml version="5.5"&gt;  &lt;displayversion&gt;5.0.5&lt;/displayversion&gt;  &lt;factory id="1" uuid="046e7c74fd734809885d35e99ac9eeb2"&gt;     &lt;description&gt;channel&lt;/description&gt;     &lt;manufacturer&gt;apple&lt;/manufacturer&gt;     &lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;   also, you could hire someone that has paid for motion to make a trivial transition and test that it works for your needs

you should be able to do this using shared libraries, which would probably be the easiest way and not cause any problems with permissions or anything like that, however it would probably end up with number of separate libraries rather than just having a one large library.  update:  having had a bit of a look into the shared libraries feature it could be a decent option if combined with itunes dj - which can be turned on in preferences if currently off.  essentially you would require everyone to turn sharing on for their itunes library (or specific playlists) then have one of your computers acting as a master which has itunes dj setup
if you're using an apple tv to play this content on the tv i share your pain, and the time to convert everything is also a pain! this is an alternative suggestion, not an answer to your question.  if your main goal here is to simply watch the content, and you'd prefer not to have to rip, then perhaps xbmc to simply view it may be a better option for you (it was for me).  i gave up transcoding everything months ago because of the problems you describe, the long time it took to do it, and all of the steps to get it from the pvr and disc initially into itunes

to have a portion of the string returned, the format would be:  set stringvariable2 to (characters n through n of stringvariable1) as string   n is the character number of the string starting at 1 as string is important or otherwise you get a list of single characters returned  in your example of removing the last character, it would be:  set stringvariable2 to (characters 1 through ((length of stringvariable1) - 1) of stringvariable1) as string

yes.   move your mouse curser to the left/right edge of the launch bar
filezilla can also do full sftp (ftp over ssh) and it's free.  the downside obviously is it's not a very pretty application under osx.

there may be a way to view your cpu's clock speed at this exact second, but as mentioned elsewhere, it is a constantly changing variable (due to turbo charge)
gmail keeps no such logs, and neither does mail.app  unfortunately, you're kind of stuck searching for the messages yourself.  if you read a lot of text-based mail, and want a "buffer" of sorts to prevent yourself from doing this in the future, a command line mail client like alpine can be configured to only synchronize changes like message flags/folders on a configured interval, rather than immediately on the remote side.  homebrew has a package for it: brew install alpine 
siri makes use of nlp(natural language processing) - nlp computing takes significant resources and while the iphone may be powerful enough to process them, it's likely to drain the battery
this might not be exactly what your looking for but bare feats has several articles on the current state (or lack there of) video cards for the mac pro.  take a look at cuda compatible gpus for the mac pro and abandoning apple 'blessed' gpus  i recently had to replace a second dying nvidia 8800 gt in my mac pro (early 2008) but decided to stick with an apple card
move it into ~/library/screen savers if you are the only one who wants to use it, or into /library/screen savers if you want all users on the machine to have access to it (note ~/library is hidden by default in lion: you can access it by holding option when clicking the “go to” menu in finder). 
this is a quite old question, but i stumbled on it looking for the same thing (although on ml)
you can use your macbook in clamshell mode, which disables the internal display, by closing the lid when your mac is connected to the display (and ac power is connected)

the only thing really necessary is figuring out the ip address of the mac host, and browse to that ip address on the windows client machine.  for example, if your mac host has the ip address 10.0.1.35, you should be able to browse to http://10.0.1.35.  if you have configured a firewall on the mac, you probably want to disable that, or allow communication on port 80 to pass.  if you have configured named based virtual hosts in apache, additionally you'll want to add entries to windows' hosts file in %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts, for example:  10.0.1.35 epwbst  
let your friends sign you up for a free icloud account using their device.  once you have a username/password in icloud, you can upload photos and share things quite well using the web app.   https://icloud.com   there isn't a provision to pay for icloud - so you need to sign up on the coattails of a hardware purchase.

if it's a certified apple reseller you will get exactly the same product as when purchasing at www.apple.com or the apple store.  if it's another shop that is not certified by apple, you should ask them (how are we here supposed to know?).  you will get the same level of support

to restore your device…   put your device into recovery mode   turn the device off holding the home button, connect it to your computer.  itunes should prompt to restore the device. follow the instructions.   if you have find my iphone enabled, you will need to log in to icloud and remove the device from your account before you can restore it.

to strictly answer your question, it is not possible to delete something from your device and have it remain and accessible from icloud photo library
the quickest way to get the entire list is to use finder's help and search for "symbols used in shortcuts" and refer the to the canonical list of symbols
it's hard to really know why the authors of the tool made a specific choice without tracking them down in many cases, but this one shouldn't be hard to guess.  xcode is how apple distributes a working c compiler to each version of os x

xcode comes with an uninstaller
you can find what the exclamation point means in calendar help>view events>calendar symbols:    the explanation "the item isn’t recognized as a valid entry by the server" is somewhat misleading
afaik these display are not hdcp compliant therefore you'll have some troubles watching movies that have these protections
i use a utility called port map to do this
disk utility doesn't resize fat or exfat partitions on the fly, so you will need to take that drive to a windows or unix computer or use another tool to resize fat.  if you only have disk utility, i would create a dmg of the fat partition and save it to the main partition.  then you could delete the fat partition, resize the hfs partition and recreate the new fat section to your preference.  at that point you would choose the restore tab to place the contents from the disk image (.dmg file) onto the properly sized, but empty fat volume.

easiest solution i have found so far is to disable the icloud music library and open the music app so that it can delete the cached files and/or release that storage to ios to clear when needed.  details: this solution is an adaptation of solutions i found for the same issue with itunes match
no, applications are not allowed to catch presses on the headphones remote control and use it for something different than the designed feature - play/pause the playing song. 
based on the page  http://lifehacker.com/5841097/how-to-delete-or-archive-attachments-in-apple-mail-and-free-up-disk-space i used the steps bellow.  ** method recommended only for those who feel comfortable using the terminal **   open the terminal app (applications > utilities > terminal)  change to the directory/folder with the emails typing in the terminal window  $ cd ~/library/mail/v2  list the folders you have   $ ls   or  $ ls -1  you will obtain something like:  $ ls -1 imap-info@furia.com.br@pop.furia.com.br imap-infofuria@imap.gmail.com maildata mailboxes  go to the folder of the account you want to clean, list the files and the result shows one or more mbox  $ cd imap-info@furia.com.br@pop.furia.com.br $ ls -1 inbox.mbox   or  $ ls -1 inbox.mbox inbox0.mbox inbox1014.mbox  if you have only one mbox, go to this folder, list it and you will see  $ cd inbox.mbox $ ls ce7ae9-c83c-410a-9406-4defb7034 archive.mbox deleted messages.mbox drafts.mbox info.plist junk.mbox sent messages.mbox trash.mbox  change to the folder of the messages sent (note the backslash before the space) and list to see the files  $ cd sent\ messages.mbox $ ls  ce7ae9-c83c-410a-9406-4defb7034 info.plist  the first file is a folder and contains all the messages and attachments in a series of subfolders
you can use the ln tool to create a symbolic link:  ln -s /users/user1/.bashrc /users/user2/.bashrc   in this example you are creating a new link for user2 pointing back to the existing file in user1's directory
you can use the tmutil tool to delete backups one by one.  sudo tmutil delete /volumes/drive_name/backups.backupdb/mac_name/yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss   if you are sure you have selected the correct name, you can delete all backups from that one mac by not passing in the time and letting it delete the entire folder:  sudo tmutil delete /volumes/drive_name/backups.backupdb/mac_name   the sudo command needs your password (and it won't echo to the screen, so just type it and pause to be sure you're dating the correct files before pressing enter). 
yes, i just did the same myself last week, though i'd recommend using a cloner (like carbon copy cloner)

this seems to be an instance where apple's push for the latest and greatest causes real world it issues.  per apple's support article, ht1822 - os x server: admin tools compatibility information, using server tools for mismatched client and server os versions just isn't supported:     to administer lion server from a client with a different version of os x, connect to the server using screen sharing or apple remote desktop
download and describe fuse-ext2 as described here and then run something like  mkdir /volumes/linux sudo mount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk2s6 /volumes/linux   you can figure out the device from looking at the output of diskutil list.

praise the beardless moon king! the issue was solved by connecting an external mouse via blue tooth and just clicking around the screen.  i was fortunate this had previously been set up, so it only required turning on the mouse to connect
since you already know the software way, how about permanent removal (the hardware way).  open it and unplug the cable

i asked this question so i could answer it, as i said there are a lot of people asking me about this issue.  on this page of apple's support website, you can find a list of worldwide carriers and the features they support on the iphone. 
use the latest .tgz package:  here is the installation version from the documentation (the -12.09-2 part of the file name is current-release specific and will change):  wget http://ess.r-project.org/downloads/ess/ess-12.09-2.tgz tar -xvf ess-12.09-2.tgz mv ess-12.09-2 /applications/emacs.app/contents/resources/site-lisp/ echo "(require 'ess-site)" &gt;&gt; ~/.emacs  
theoretically, there should only be updates in that folder until you actually run the updates, then they should be cleared - so my first suggestion would be to check the app store app &amp; run any pending updates from there, reboot, then recheck the folder.  anything left over at that point ought to be safe to delete, though i would retain the index.plist ppdversions.plist &amp; productmetadata.plist files, if present, unless you are having general updating issues, as i suspect they are designed to accurately track the update state. 
i also have the ar xi on my mba 10.9.2.     architecture: i386      build: 11.0.06.70      agm: 4.28.134      cooltype: 5.11.135      jp2k: 2.0.0.32097   so far no crashes here with any kind of pdf, online or of line, in german and english with > 70 pages long ect..  maybe you should look in your console after a crash to see what is doing it.  additionally some more information:  the adobe reader is not recommendable when editing latex documents because it is uncomfortable regarding forward and inverse search between source code and pdf output
the hardware is capable of 30fps, i have this model (macbookpro9,1, i7 2.3 ghz) on my desk in front of me and just shot a movie that lists as 29.81fps at 720p.  however, apple will, in software, reduce the frame rate if your hdd/ssd/other storage and/or processor and memory are not capable of handling the maximum frame rate at the time of capture
unfortunately, information would not be attainable simply through the serial number
in system preferences you can go to keyboard/shortcuts.   in the list on the left side click: app shortcuts and create a new shortcut. pick wunderlist and for menu item pick stop or close wunderlist just type it exactly like it is typed in the menu in wunderlist. in the last field put a custom key code and save.  like i did for safari this should do the trick 
most likely no because it's proprietary technology.  apple's remote disc functionality is provided by the host os which has to be os x or windows having the proper drivers installed
the built in full screen (lion) dominates both screens - and i've not been able to find any setting which lets me use the other one for anything else
your best bet is to follow the instructions on this page.  things you'll need:   flash drive bigger than 4 gb (8 gb+ would be best) installesd.dmg (extracted from the os x lion app, if you've saved it prior to the upgrade)   there's an alternate method mentioned here.  note: if you don't have the  lion install app, follow the instructions on this page to download it again. 
i'm not sure if using a fake address would be legal
what version of photoshop are you using? apparently adobe dropped support for exporting with jfif at some point, and replaced it with exif.  you can try an app like xnview to strip out meta data:  http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;t=24056  i just tried this with an exif jpeg on my computer, opened it in xnview, and then selected:  tools &gt; export &gt; [√] remove all metadata &gt; save…   the resulting file remained a jpeg, but had a jfif header.

updated 17 dec 2013.  as reported by macworld, the ibookstore now allows you to gift books:     gifting in the ibookstore works identically to apple’s itunes and app store counterparts: just choose the book you’d like to gift, then tap either the dropdown arrow next to the price (on a mac) or the share button (on an ios device).   more details are in their article, but by-and-large it seems to behave exactly as you would expect.    my original answer:  you can’t; ibook gifting isn’t supported yet.  from apple’s ibooks faqs page:     can i gift a book?      no, you cannot gift a book in the ibookstore at this time.   the phrase “at this time” suggests that it’s coming in the future, but apple haven’t announced anything yet. 
go into settings.app and then go to mail, contacts, calendars.  scroll down the to mail section...    i hope this helps!

according to this article, there is no way to turn off burst mode.     this can be quite handy for catching just the right shot
yeah you sure can! find the picture in the photos app, press the menu button in the bottom left corner and press use as wallpaper. 
you want to remove "write permission" from the file, so it cannot be written to
i actually asked a similar question (but more broad so this isn't a duplicate)
i haven't tested this under lion but   defaults write com.apple.launchservices lsquarantine -bool no   and then restarting should totally disable this functionality. 
the only way i can think of is run an script with an idle handler that periodically checks to see if the server is available and if so executes another script or another portion of the same script. 
steps to evaluate where it comes from.   switch user to see if it is user specific restore disk permissions. start in safe mode to eliminate 3d party applications it looks like it is a left over from some app that did not close properly, next time if it happens remember what app you just closed.   if problem persists, use apple hardware test
 set up time machine the first time you start you mac, set up software update so that your system is always up to date. a shutdown once in a while should clean most of little garbage but you will have to perform it anyway with some software updates.   and   never log in with administrative privileges unless you have a serious reason to do so.  
one thing you can try is to hold alt while selecting scaled in the display pane of the displays view in system preferences
there could be a few reasons, but your security settings are probably the most likely candidates.  temporarily turn off the firewall  the easiest way to test this is to (very) temporarily turn off your firewall:  system preferences > security &amp; privacy > firewall > turn off firewall         retest your connectivity, if it works, turn your firewall back on and then allow the app through the firewall. 
"i would like to know if hard drive access speed is a bottleneck to my system currently."  of course! there are two aspects to a disk storage system:   bus speed storage medium speed   on any given bus, e.g., sata, sata2, sata3, a mechanical hdd will be an order of magnitude slower than an ssd for a given link speed
yes, but it only works on unibody macs
iterm supports coloring of console output based on a set of regular expressions
you can charge an iphone with any reputable usb charger, but unless it is designed for apple will charge very slowly (~100ma the usb default).  in some cases (this is based on earlier ipod dock) the device will refuse to charge if it incapable of negotiating a charge rate.  you would have more luck plugging into a computer
there is unfortunately no way to do this on a situational basis

the service is only free to users of the iphone 4, and if i recall correctly users of the ipad.     it’s a feature that’s part of mobileme, but now it’s also free on every iphone 4 with ios 4.2.*   from the apple website, bold mine  to use this functionality on any other device requires a full mobileme subscription
you can just replace the file in the filesystem.  unfortunately, itunes is too clever for it's own boots and registers for finder events

i re-partitioned and re-formatted the drive to the exact same file system (one partition, fat32), and now it works
if your devices have os x yosemite and ios 8 or anything newer, there's a built-in way to do this via a wired connection.   connect your iphone, ipad or ipod touch to your mac via a lightning cable. open quicktime on your mac, and select file > new movie recording. a recording window will appear
first option, there are some excellent services that provide online backup solutions for a reasonable price
no, each desktop (space) will have the same resolution, whatever the display's resolution is set at.  you could use an app like display menu to more easily/quickly change the resolution as needed/wanted as you change between desktops. 
try this:   launch terminal.app from /applications/utilities/ type defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean no and press return. type killall dock and press return.  
here's the gui scripting solution:  tell application "system preferences"     reveal anchor "mouse" of pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"     tell application "system events"         tell process "system preferences"             tell first window                 tell first tab group                     tell radio group 1                         if value of radio button 1 is 1 then                             # enabled, so disable                             click radio button 2                         else                             # disabled, so enable                             click radio button 1                         end if                     end tell                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell     quit end tell   it will launch system preferences if required, but doesn't show the window and quits it afterwards, so from a ui pov, it at least doesn't show the window.    you can change the persistent setting on which the system preferences configuration is based using the following commands:  defaults write ~/library/preferences/com.apple.universalaccess mousedriver -bool yes defaults write ~/library/preferences/com.apple.universalaccess mousedriver -bool no   unfortunately, this only changes the configuration file and does not apply the changes to the running system.    while you can programmatically press option keys using applescript, like the following:  tell application "system events"     key down option     key up option end tell   the press option five times to toggle setting is at a higher level and doesn't get triggered by this
try "searchterm not kind:message" 
yes
i have created separate playlists for my devices (one for music and one for video)
found the answer! this feature is invisible and you have to know it's there.     to shuffle songs within a genre in your library, do the following:         tap the "my music" tab.   tap the selection in the divider at the top between "recently added" and the music list
no success in restoring the file, like patrix points out
you can do it using applescript and bbedit's results browser command
for f in "$@"; do new="$(echo -n "$f" | sed -e 's|/$||;s| +$||;s|^ +||;s|/ +([^/]+$)|/\1|;s| +(\.[^.][a-za-z0-9.]*)$|\1|g')"; mv "$f" "$new"; echo "$new"; done  (paste as a run shell script action and select pass input: as arguments.) 
right click the song in itunes and choose get info
it means that although not officially supported, the 1533 model will work with spanish carriers if you purchase a sim in spain
if you want it right now, why not plug the phone into the mac &amp; use image capture, in the applications folder - which is the importer 'behind' photos.app.  you can also set it to auto-launch any capable app, including itself, when a device is connected [or do nothing] &amp; set exactly where your imports should be saved
since you have bettertouchtool, this is pretty easy
you can set the default boot disk in system preferences>startup disk.   
 i solved this using mac os x lion install dvd
the solution provided by @konrad rudolph is not entirely correct anymore as the gcc formula that he mentioned was moved from homebrew/dupes to homebrew/versions
textedit → preferences → open and save    set “plain text file encoding” to “unicode (utf-8)” for both opening and saving files.  if that doesn’t fix it already, open terminal.app and enter the following:  echo "0x08000100:0" &gt; ~/.cfusertextencoding   then logout and login again.  this fixes the ancient utf-8 bug in os x that also manifest in quicklook.  to fix it for just a single file rather than for all files (i don’t see why you would, though), just write the extended attribute that textedit uses:  xattr -w com.apple.textencoding 'utf-8;134217984' filename.txt   hope this helps! 
get safari download manager from cydia so that you can download it and ifile which lets you play it. 
there's no official way to achieve this.  you have to jailbreak your ipad and use a software like displayout (works on all idevices) to do this. 
well it seems that maps only want decimals : 45.196000, 5.765600  too bad it isn't as flexible as gmaps
it seems like that behaviour was never been implemented in firefox on os x.  see this bug report
you can press ⌘ cmd + ⇧ shift + . while the dialog is open, which will toggle show/hide hidden files.  in osx 10.9 and up (mavericks, yosemite, ...) you need to be in the list view of finder
the issue is likely due to the fact that the build of snow leopard you're using is incorrect and thus does not have the necessary drivers for your imac
since ipfw is also removed in yosemite the solution is to use pf  create a file in /etc/pf.anchors/  e.g
it comes from launch services, specifically this binary  /system/library/frameworks/coreservices.framework/versions/a/frameworks/launchservices.framework/versions/a/launchservices   and that environment variable seems to be inherited by many processes, as you can see with ps -efax  1436934 looks like the number of digits in recent apple "radar" bug numbers, so perhaps it refers to some value used internally for testing. 
keynote for ipad doesn't support links inside the presentation itself (per apple's keynote for ipad faq)
os x 10.5: go to security in system preferences.app, then select disable remote control infrared receiver at the bottom.  newer versions of os x: go to security and privacy in system preferences.app, then click on advanced at the bottom and select disable remote control infrared receiver. 
ssh-agent can do this: use ssh-add -k path/to/key to store the passphrase for the key in your keychain
this will help users running lion but won't solve your problem in leopard
try using dscacheutil -flushcache in the terminal on the mac. 
this is actually insanely simple:  open itunes and go into your music library
figured it out, it could be that i did this in the old itunes and because it was years ago i forgot and that updating itunes reset every setting  anyway, here are the steps i followed   click on the icon in the top left hand corner and select show menu bar (or ctrl + b) click on view > show view options (or ctrl + j (you may be able to skip step 1 but i didn't use shortcuts)) make sure sort by is set to album click in the checkbox beside show artwork make sure that under the music section that the checkbox beside album is checked, if it is not the albums will not be sorted alphabetically like they really should, while you can sort by what ever way want sorting by name will split albums and you'll only see the groups if 2 or more in the list have belong to the same album (ie
running snow leopard in a virtual machine will run ppc and some carbon apps on a lion mac
the system stores the boot choice in nvram, so you might reset it by powering off and then holding command-option-p-r while you hear the start chimes repeat 2 or 3 times
right click on the misspelled word and select “unlearn spelling”.  as pages uses os x’ global spelling services,  you can use this method anywhere text input is spell checked by it (more or less any text area, with the notable exceptions of ms office, openoffice / libreoffice, firefox and a few other apps ported from the non os x world)
i don't know whether the oxs settings will propagate somehow to iphone
i am not aware of any apps that can do that
all you need to do is plug your iphone into itunes, click on it under devices:    and click "restore":    itunes will make sure that you do actually want to restore:    jailbreaking does not make any permanent changes; a restore will put your iphone back exactly the way it was before you jailbroke it.

there is a duplicate question covering this, but the answer is tmutil status will tell you any time a backup is in progress as well as details about the backup.  you can use tmutil then to turn off backups if desired or even read the list of backups so you can predict how many minutes to the next scheduled backup
itunes 10.5.1 beta 3 was released yesterday, which is a good indicator that it will be formally released real soon now. 
here's an extension that will let you do it in google chrome: https://github.com/nqzero/knogs  at the bottom of that page is a link to do the same thing in safari (i can't link to it directly from here because i don't have the reputation for it).  i haven't tried either version though.  personally, i use mafuyu (http://wakabamac.blog95.fc2.com/blog-entry-1013.html)
ok..
in the menu bar, go safari -> preferences
on your iphone:     open the settings app   go to general->usage   under the storage section, wait till it shows the list of apps   click on the app you're interested in to see the app version, the app size and the amount of data it has stored on the device.   this works only for third party apps
there is no easy way to do this, you only have one artist field per track.  what you could do is listing the name of all artists in the artist field and then create smart playlists with rules for "artist contains".

i reset the smc and the superdrive is working again. 
backup means copying your personal data from your phone to your computer
you should definitely try resetting the smc, since it's a known fix for fan issues. here are the instructions: resetting the system management controller. 
there is a alternative way to do that.  go to system/library/sounds and create a sound file with the same name as basso.aiff and it will supersede basso without the need for deleting a system sound file.

i don't have an iphone anymore, but my memory tells me this:  iphone  search using the standard search bar.   the web search suggestions are at the top. the website search results of the currently viewed website are at the bottom.   ipad  search using the standard search bar.   the web search suggestions are at the top. to search the website use the entry box which pops up right above the keyboard.   all of this may change with ios 6 and mountain lion
after you choose the character go to the font variation section you might need to click on the triangle at its left side to expand this
apple computers have long been considered "virus free" although apple stopped pushing this as a selling point earlier this year in the wake of several apple targeted viruses. the truth is that a virus can be programmed for mac much like a software application can, the reason for the lack if infections on mac was merely the same as the reason for lack of some apps in the past, the relative unpopularity vs windows machines meant it was less practical to program for mac. with macs now being more popular than ever before, apple now has to implement strict measures to hold on to their clean, virus free image, hence gatekeeper being added to mountain lion.

the best guide to reference here is : http://manuals.info.apple.com/manuals/1000/ma1594/en_us/thunderbolt_display_getting_started.pdf  to use your apple thunderbolt display with your macbook pro lid closed:   connect an external usb keyboard and mouse to a usb port on your display, or use the bluetooth® setup assistant to set up a wireless keyboard and mouse. make sure your macbook pro is turned on. close the lid on your macbook pro to put it to sleep. wait a few seconds, and then press any key on your external keyboard or click the mouse to wake up your macbook pro

here's a few different ways you can access the old user's files:     recreate the deleted account, and log in with it:   in system preferences > users &amp; groups, click the padlock icon and then the plus button to create a new user name the user "abby" - the os should ask you if you want to use the existing home folder - choose to do so from the apple menu, choose "log out" log in as "abby" and you will have access to the old account again       use the "system administrator" account to access the files:   navigate to the folder "/system/library/coreservices/" and open "directory utility.app" click the padlock in the "edit" menu, choose "enable root user" from the apple menu, choose "log out" log in as "system administrator" (or "root") and you will have access to the files in "/users/abby"       change the permissions of the old home folder:   right-click the "/users/abby" folder and choose "get properties" click the padlock at the very bottom of the "get info" window click the "+" button at the very bottom of the "get info" window select your current account from the users list give your current user (at the very bottom of the "get info" window) to have "read &amp; write" privs from the gear menu choose "make (me) the owner" from the gear menu choose "apply to enclosed items..."      if you want information on how this occurred, i just answered a similar question yesterday

according to the apple documentation about using timemachine and migration assistant you can select all, several or no user accounts to transfer; select all or no applications; select computer settings and sub-settings or none at all; and finally, other files and folders not explicitly chosen from above.  additionally, under the user account migration you can chose to migrate a subset of the users' account folders, namely any mix of the folders desktop, document, downloads, movies, music, pictures, public (if it exists), sites (if it exists) and other files that may reside in the users's account but not in the apple default folders mentioned above.  furthermore, there are arguments for and against migrating the contents of the applications folder

no, because the capture is capturing the pixels that comprise the selected area, not the 'screen' as it is displayed to you.  it's something i've wished for in the past, too.

i believe (for clarification) that you are referring to the behaviour whereby a page currently open in a tab will be "flushed" from memory, such that the tab and it's title remain but when you switch back to it will have to load the page again in order to show it to you.  this is new to safari 5.1, and mirrors the similar actions that happen in ios devices with mobile safari.  unfortunately there is no way to stop this short of reverting to a previous version of safari, or using a different browser

if you've tried all physical options, removing hubs, changing cables, ports etc, then the remaining likelihood is that the existing backup is corrupt.  simplest method would be to find your backups folder &amp; rename/delete the corrupt one, then test again…   disconnect phone, quit itunes switch to finder  cmd ⌘   n  for new window  cmd ⌘   shift ⇧   g  for go to… copy/paste ~/library/application support/mobilesync/backup/ &amp; hit  enter ⌅  or  return⏎   change the name of the folder with the long, complex number - just add .bak or something to the end of it
i'd try writing a simple script:  #!/bin/bash sudo /usr/bin/id   save this as something.command, change its permissions to executable with chmod +x, and then run this from applescript with  osascript -e 'do shell script "open -a terminal ./something.command"'   instead of /usr/bin/id you can call whatever script you need to run with admin privileges then.  edit:  this will work:  osascript -e 'do shell script "sudo /applications/utilities/terminal.app/contents/macos/terminal" with administrator privileges'  
it sounds like you are in rich text mode, so the editor is trying to save the file in non-plain text format

pulling the ram seems a reliable way to constrain that resource.  running in virtualization should help if you can tell your preferred stack to allocate less threads or cores, but i would question your main assumption that these are the critical bottlenecks for making your simulations valuable.  why not let the simulations run full speed and just measure where the bottlenecks on the mac arise

the default behavior is for icloud photo library not to store full-size versions of your photos on your iphone and ipad:    the theory is that only thumbnails are stored on your iphone/ipad until you decide to view/edit/share the photo, at which point a device-optimized or full-size version of your photo is downloaded from icloud.  (note: i know a full-size copy is downloaded when you edit/share, but it appears that if your iphone has plenty of space it will download a full-size copy for viewing as well, as opposed to just a device-optimized version
turn off time machine with the switch in system preferences, then remove the backups.backupdb from drive a.  time machine should recognise that the disk is no longer a time machine backup destination, but if it doesn't, delete .com.apple.timemachine.donotpresent from the root of the disk.

its old question , but still if it helps anyone.  you need following 2 in order to maximise your window when clicked on title bar:        go to apple icon > system preferences > dock >        select "double-click a window's title bar to" "zoom"   shift + double click on title bar to maximise the window.      cheers  
hmmm, it's not possible
it's not so much your version of apache/php have been reverted - it's just the wrong version is loaded.  if you have mac os x's web sharing enabled it will auto enable the version of apache and php apple provides using the launchdaemon org.apache.httpd.plist in /system/library/launchdaemons (this will override macports version)
you can use unetbootin to copy the linux iso to 1.2gb partition(disk4s3).  if i were you though i would first rewrite the partition type as gpt instead of apm by running:  diskutil partitiondisk disk4 gpt fat32 linux 10% exfat d2 10% exfat d3 80%   then select the linux partition on disk4 in unetbootin to be the destination for the iso copy. 
in osx 10.9 and above this is all in activity monitor app under the energy tab
i am assuming this process will work out to be the same as the current situation with  iphones:   backup your ipad using itunes. plug new ipad into same computer. restore new ipad from old ipad backup.   when this is done with an iphone, the new iphone will be configured exactly as the old one - save games, email apps, photos, everything is transfered.  what happens is actually that the backup contains all app data + configuration
you need to use your addressbook application for that and sync the iphone again.  there is no group support but for reading on ios.   you can't create groups you can't move to and from groups you can only create a contact in a group if a group exists － windows user can edit your group through icloud.com/contacts  
you're talking about the notification settings for mail, not whether push is on
if the song is already in itunes, it's easy to do it right within it
you can do peer-to-peer networking on bluetooth with some games and other applications.  i haven't checked out the details but my understanding is that the bluetooth profile is much better in the iphone 4 and ipad than in the early iphones
in answer to whether a 64-bit installation shows up, listed as 32-bit in the task manager, per https://discussions.apple.com/message/18034729#18034729:   that's normal on a 64-bit version of itunes
simply use open:  open "/applications/intellij idea 13 ce.app"     open -a "intellij idea 13 ce"     however, prepending sudo isn't enough to run as root
if you get a blank line from pandoc then something is quite amiss.  my guess is you've got several `pandoc or the tex file is encoded oddly or throwing some error that the version i downloaded from dropbox isn't the same as the one you are using.  $ pandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | wc       311    1349   11676 $ pandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | head  &lt;p&gt;everything - etiology, symptoms, diagnostic tests, grades of aortic valve stenosis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;aortic regurgitation
i've never run into any issues like that using bootcamp
edit:  as it turns out, disabling resume upon login is enough.    with applescript, this is a nice solution.  set theapplist to {{name:"growl", vis:false}, {name:"caffeine", vis:false}, {name:"boom", vis:false}, {name:"shimo", vis:false}, {name:"twitter", vis:false}} set thedelay to 0.5  repeat with currentapp in theapplist     tell application (name of currentapp) to launch     delay thedelay     tell application "finder" to set visible of process (name of currentapp) to (vis of currentapp) end repeat   important note  you need to disable resume upon login for this script to work

try switching tabs in the app store or restart the app store application and see if you can get it to refresh and show the progress bar + a stop button in the updates tab
there really isn't a one size fits all answer, but i can think of four ways to accomplish your task if you care to spend some time setting this up.    macs are unix, so simply check in your ~/library/preferences and /library/preferences into some sort of code control system
hold down the option key when you launch itunes
yup, apparently it is missing and you have to install edk to get it. 
according to this article on macosxhints you can press ctrl-alt to get altgr. sometimes that doesn't work, so you'll have to remap your keys under windows, which is described in the linked to article.  there's also this article on parallels' forums which suggests you do this:        stop any running vms, close all instances of parallels desktop for mac.   launch “macintosh hd” - “applications” – “utilities” – “terminal”.   type the following commands in terminal (without quotes), please mind that the system might ask you for the administrator password after each command – type it and hit enter:   “sudo touch /library/parallels/.keyboard_config”   “sudo chmod 666 /library/parallels/.keyboard_config”   “sudo echo "numenterisaltgr" > /library/parallels/.keyboard_config”   close the terminal.   launch parallels desktop for mac and check right enter key behavior in vm – everything should work as you’ve set.     
if you connect 18 v to the power/ground pins, your mac will be powered off the 12 v battery, but it won't charge: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/132332/26231  to charge, the laptop needs to identify the charger by communicating over the signal pin in the middle
display recorder from the same author does exactly that.  thanks to vaccano. 
i haven’t tried any way of resizing the partitions through disk utility, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible
this seems to work on el capitan
yes, you have full access to the disk utility program from within the installer process, so you can partition and format to your hearts content. 
   obviously the os is consuming more memory for internal tasks, but why exactly?   newer versions of software is developed for and tested on newer hardware, which is more capable

this is kind of a yes/no question
i already answered a related question
in a word, no.  apple didn't want to hand over the responsibility of application and memory management to the user, and personally i'm glad that they made that decision.  the purpose of the multitasking bar is to allow users to switch between apps and to quit apps in order to open them afresh (in case of crashes or weird behaviour).  ios doesn't actually allow 3rd party apps to continually run in the background

with the advent of notification center, the display of badges on any app can now be managed alongside display of banners, popups, and other notification-related settings.  go to the notifications preference pane in system preferences, and select the mail app from the list - the option to turn off the dock badge should be there.  you may need to restart mail for this change to take effect, though on 10.8.4 i do not.

turns out i solved the issue by just wiping my phone and restoring it from that same sept 27 icloud backup again
i solved it myself.  for reference here's the steps i followed.  on the itunes menu open store->view account, then in account summary click "deauthorize all computer/devices/whatever.." (i'm translating in english the steps)  i wasn't able to do this on the menu with store->remove authorization, because it was asking me to be authorized first to do it (and i already had 5 authorized computers).

if they are using real unicode emoji, you cannot see them without the apple color emoji font, which only works in 10.7, or possibly by downloading and installing a black/white font that has them, like symbola or quivira.  unicode emoji were only standardized in october of 2010 and i think there are various apps which may not recognize them anyway

apple remote desktop http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/ might be what you are looking for. 
no, however if you were already running ml, and you had a flash-storage based mac that supported powernap, then it would likely be able to do so as part of it's ability to automatically download updates etc (which are provided through the mac app store) when in sleep.  bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy though ;)

the answer is to use control+option+enter, which will create a line break in the cell.  as an alternative, control+command+enter can also be used to achieve the same.  these combinations work both in excel for mac 2011 and the new excel for mac 2015.  as pointed out by shameer in this answer, alt+enter now seems to work as well in the new excel for mac 2015. 
network issues only ever result in the audio cutting out, they can't really change the content.  distortion means your speakers get overloaded
 .command - (terminal shell script) specifically associates a shell script with terminal
the battery serial number is written physically on the bottom of the battery:   also, in order to ensure at the official repair store that the battery is genuine (which was originally my purpose), the same serial number is on the box the battery comes in:   ...and also in the official papers accompanying the repair part.  of course, both the box and the battery inside of the box should be sealed and opened for you only just before the replacement operation. 
 back up your data. boot into the recovery system by holding ⌘+r during early boot. select disk utility and format your drive where os x and your files were stored on. quit disk utility and select "install mountain lion".  
   considering that pmstats reports a hibernation write time of over eight seconds, this leads me into thinking it is the ram content.   exactly
i contacted the apple support hotline and got the expected answer: setting up a mac mini without an external monitor is not possible (unless you happen to know and correctly perform the exact order of keystrokes necessary to complete the setup with an attached keyboard).  this actually got me thinking: what if i could attach a pre-programmed keyboard that delivers the required input timed appropriately to the required wait-times, etc and generate a universal "mac setup adapter"? i could imagine the "teensyduino" being the prefect fit for this job

using the botany sample, the text boxes seem to work as expected with the caveat that you have to intentionally click on one of the four corner handles of the text box to make the blue linking triangles appear.  i took a small video showing the controls reacting to mouse events.  from there, linking works as expected from the perspective of pages.   
your macbook pro does not contain the necessary hardware to support airdrop.  in os x, the feature didn't use bluetooth, instead using bonjour and personal area networking over wifi to discover and transfer files between macs.  when ios gained the feature in version 7, it was a completely different implementation, using bluetooth le and wifi direct

your iphone 4 supports ios 5.0, which can now sync photos wirelessly using photo stream.  for setup instructions, see http://support.apple.com/kb/ph2605 
if you can't delete the paused download (which, i'm thinking, suggests you aren't on the most recent release of ios), then the simplest option that doesn't require a restore is going to be to find a wifi hotspot and let the app finish downloading
first, you should authorize your computer with your ipad if you haven't already

all app downloaded from mac appstore(mas) contain a receipt inside their app bundle (example: appname.app/contents/_masreceipt/receipt)
i can't speak for any official mechanism to report violations, but the system is set up to field consumer complaints and if everyone was explicit about their complaints - it might help apple step in and address the worst of the worst:   you should send a message to the developer (since you are about to poo over their product on the app store) - give them a chance to make things right since they might have a fix or be able to assist you directly
check out ssd health on the mac app store: http://ssdhealth.com/macos.html 
i believe this is to protect against user error - the kind of thing that happens when an inexperienced user doesn't realise that s/he has every photo in their library selected and then opts to send to the external editor

it's actually pretty simple, in that, if it is not in the app store it can't be installed, unless you want to go the jailbreak route because you found an "r" app for jailbroken ios devices. 
try this se question and answer:  actually, you should be able to do it by removing a hidden system file which tells os x that setup has run.  it's a hidden file, so you will have to remove it using terminal, or show hidden files in finder
one option would be to used your other macbook pro to create a linux boot cd or usb drive, then boot your macbook from that
it turns out that only one airport at a time is visible via back to my mac
if you just want to make a quick copy of a graphic inside a pdf for your evernote, scale it big enough and make a (rectangular selected) screenshot of it (⌘⇧4).  as for copying a graphic from pdf into photoshop: i think it would be a good strategy to save the pdf as tiff (selecting a high enough resolution in the export dialog) and then cutting out the region that you need

this is not exactly the same as the minimum font size setting that was previously available, but it can rectify the issue in most irritating cases
there is no way (yet) to change that without jailbreak tweak
as usual for cleanup stuff, start with a visualizer like grandperspective or disk inventory x so you can see what folders take up space.  be careful deleting stuff in your library folder: apps store lots of different things in there, some of which are required for them to run. 
sounds like this was due to them creating a new user (502) and naming it the same as the old user, and copying all your old files in
the built-in ios keyboard does not support this, but you can add a shortcut from settings > general > keyboard
add it to your .bash_profile by running nano ~/.bash_profile and adding  alias ll='ls -ll'   control + x, then y, then enter to save the file.  restart terminal

since you didn't mention you had a backup of the system or if you are equipped to troubleshoot a driver issue, you should probably not update things unless you have a problem.  apple vets the drivers it provides to be sure they work well with mac hardware - so although you are free to update drivers, you are skipping that vetting process
carefully move the pointer to the left side of the finder window border till the cursor changes to arrow pointing to the right.  ↦  hold and drag to the right.  if that did not work you need to restore the finders preferences.  in terminal run   rm ~/library/preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist   and   rm ~/library/preferences/com.apple.finder.plist    restart.

this problem seems to crop up occasionally, and i haven't heard a definitive solution outside of the standard troubleshooting routines: determine if the problem is a software setting by creating a new user account, rebuild permissions, and so on.  beyond the basics, there are two solutions that might help
if these applications offer the ability to hide the dock item, and live only in the menu bar, then they will not show up in the command+tab switcher list
since the messages beta has ended, it is no longer offered for download on the website however the download link direct to the .dmg still works:  messages beta direct download.  i don't expect this to continue indefinitely.  a more permanent option would be to try and copy the messages.app from a mountain lion install on another computer to your os x lion applications folder

yup, if you no longer want it on your system, those are the two biggest offenders in terms of size
you'll need to copy two files from the old installation of osx:  ~/library/preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist ~/library/preferences/widget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist   the first tells dashboard which widgets to show, the second contains your notes.  copy these to your new ~/library/preferences and you should be good.  you'll need to restart, logout and login, or kill the dock, for example by opening terminal and running killall dock.  it worked for me - but i should warn that my home path was the same on the old install and new install. 
according to this images from apple's kb article, it appears to be between the z and shift.   
you can't.  restoring from another device's backup will update to the latest ios the restored device can use.  the only way would be to restore from a backup initially made from that same device, using that ios.

you are confusing your icloud backup with icloud photo library.  icloud backup by default makes a copy of your whole ios device, in case you have a problem with it (you erase something by mistake, it gets stolen, lost, damaged) to be able to restore it to the last available backup.  you can selectively remove different data from the backup, that —of course— won't be available to restore later on.  icloud photo library is a different service: it will allow you to upload all your full size pictures to icloud, save a smaller sized copy on your device to save space (if you set it that way) and sync them between different devices.  so "the cloud" has a copy of your whole phone for backup purposes because you activated icloud backup
if you're still looking for a method to darken your ui in yosemite, download flavours 2 and choose the "smooth criminal" flavour.   flavours 2 is still in beta, but most things look great with this skin. 
yes you can configure the dynamic_pager, but for most it is simpler to just disable it and see which program crashes due to the inevitable out of memory errors.  why would i disable swap file in mac os x?  pay attention to programs that implement their own virtual memory / cache / paging systems like virtualization and the adobe suite in case you have inadvertently tuned them to use more ram than is available on the system
if you uncheck "live updating" in the smart playlist edit screen you will be able to delete tracks from the smart playlist

as mentioned by the other comments, apple's default partition scheme is to have everything on one partition
to avoid rendering your device unusable due to a bad upgrade file, ios does some verification of the download before installing (likely some type of checksum to ensure the download wasn't corrupted and it's for the right device, etc.)
you need to tell it where to put the arguments.  for f in "$@" do     "/usr/local/bin/python" -i -o "~/development/python/slideshow/scripts/slideshow" "$f" done   …or, if you're only ever going to select one folder, you can simplify it a bit:  "/usr/local/bin/python" -i -o "~/development/python/slideshow/scripts/slideshow" "$@"

according to the technical specifications, the thunderbolt display has 2.1 stereo speakers with a subwoofer and the system is rated at 49 w.  no one would consider the any macbook pro with the small internal speakers to be superior to the wall-powered solution that is part of the display.  you will want something like an external dac if you are concerned about audio quality or want to connect speakers that are better amplified and suited to a special situation other than casual listening
in addition to histfilesize, you also need to set histsize, which controls the number of commands to keep in memory until they are saved.  also, the manual page for history is available via man bash
it's not the best way, but it works:   open terminal.app, type dirname (with space),  drug file into terminal.app, and you'll see full escaped path of file (with \ symbols if there're some spaces around). press enter and this command prints full path without escapes, copy this output (with ⌘cmd-c) with finder.app type ⌘cmd-shift-g to open this directory.   ps: to drug file into terminal you can drug this small icon on the window frame 
a pram / nvram reset (⌘-⌥-p-r on startup) fixed the delay
"128 kbps aac" - tells the system to convert audio to aac encoded files at a quality of 128kbps so this conversion is what is taking the cpu.  aac is only for audio/video and nothing to do with still images 
this question is probably more suited for http://apple.stackexchange.com/, but i can't figure out how to suggest to move it there…  if you have another mac, the easiest way is most likely to boot the mac you're trying to fix in target disk mode (hold t when you hear the chime) and connect it to your other mac via a firewire or thunderbolt cable
i was able to get what i wanted by going into the app folder contents/macos and renaming the emacs binary to emacs.real
use an alias.     the alias command allows the user to launch any command or group of   commands (including options and filenames) by entering a single word   alias rm="rm -i"   the next time you issue the command rm it will issue rm -i  you can also make a new alias in case you want to keep rm functioning as it does by default

so, for anyone who is in a similar position to me, the critical step that i was missing after getting rid of the offending .kext, was removing the various caches that were resulting in it still getting loaded during the filevault startup process.  removing /var/vm/sleep* and /var/folders/* from the filevault volume caused all the caches to be rebuilt and the system booted correctly.

after fiddling with making my own solution via fs_usage manipulation, i discovered the dtrace iotop script (man iotop)
another solution would be to create applescript containing the folowing code  tell application "finder"     empty the trash end tell   save it as emptytrash for example and execute it via open emptytrash.app  or even better (as suggested by chris) - execute:  osascript -e 'tell app "finder" to empty'   since trash is a finder thing, this should be more compatible in the long run.

official answer:  unfortunately, it is not possible to download os x lion 10.7 from a computer currently running os x mountain lion 10.8 unless you want to do a little hacking see below for more on that

you can use wget like this:  wget -r -nd -a.mp3 http://www.parweztv.com/khan%20adeeb/sura-04/   -r to recursively download all files below the level of the url specified  -nd to not create a hierarchy of directories in your download location (not necessary)  -a to specify the files you want to download (all files ending in .mp3 in your case)  you can obtain wget for osx via homebrew or macports. 
according to the tech scoop and lifehacker, there are a number of things you should do before upgrading.   make sure your computer will actually run mountain lion
you could simply use macvim to handle this

yes, the plist seems to no longer exist by default, however i have changed my save location using the same command that you provided in your question and it's worked fine — the plist is read by os x after logout and login. 
so since i've not seen any recommendations i'm going to go ahead and put forth the answer that i've gone forward with so far.  the solution so far for me has been startupizer
the first thing i would do is open spotlight system preferences and disable indexing of the external drive
according to accessing kernel memory on the x86 version of mac os x, /dev/mem and /dev/kmem were removed when apple released os x for intel processors.  the (excellent) article also explains how to reenable the memory devices, namely using the kmem=1 kernel boot argument
you can do it via an applescript and run it as such:  dimmer:   tell application "system events"         key code 107     end tell   brighter:    tell application "system events"         key code 113     end tell   you can save these as .script files and then run them from the cli like this:  osascript ~/path/to/file   you can also do it this way, but that requires more setup. 
you don't have control to allow only a subset of the photo stream to come to a particular device.  photostream takes photos from all devices that feed it, and as it's a store that apple keeps online, if a particular device subscribes to the stream, it gets a cached copy of all messages.  you can take that device out of the stream temporarily or free up other space on the device to allow the stream contents to be cached locally.  in your specific case, you could exit that stream subscription to clear the space and then have the person that owns the stream re-send it to you once you've gotten space freed up on some or all devices that need to subscribe to your collective stream. 
in mountain lion the sshd configuration (/etc/sshd_config) was changed and sshd no longer looks at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 for valid keys.  /etc/sshd_config on lion (line 46):  #authorizedkeysfile     .ssh/authorized_keys   /etc/sshd_config on mountain lion (line 48):  # the default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2 # but this is overridden so installations will only check .ssh/authorized_keys authorizedkeysfile      .ssh/authorized_keys   if you don’t wish to edit the /etc/sshd_config on the target machine you can either rename ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or symlink it.  symlink ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2  ln -s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2   rename ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2  mv ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

the following worked for me:    go to the folder that represents the notes stored on the external server click edit and choose the notes you need moved, or just swipe from the right on the individual note and tap move choose the destination target and folder: either local, or icloud   this actually moved my note from an external, imap-connected server to my icloud.    the screenshot shows both on my iphone and icloud options not greyed out, which confirms they're both available, and the note in question is currently located elsewhere

a normal copy (or copy via rsync or ditto) will not replicate a time machine fully as it will convert two directories linked together (as occurs in successive tm backups with no change between) into two separate directories.  the best way is to copy the whole the disk using disk utility or the block copy part of carbon copy cloner and probably similar on superduper

you can save the whole itunes folder(it should be at ../music/itunes directory) and just put it back after you reinstall itunes on your new windows system (new itunes installation will put it's new "blank" folder in /music, just replace with your backup copy).  by doing so idevices will recognise your library as the one they had synced with before and will continue to sync with it like nothing happened, hence keeping all the saves on the devices.

there is no need to use applescript here, you can pass data from automator directly into a shell script.    depending on where you've stored the script, you may have to include the full path to the script in the action (/path/to/video-dl "$@").

in column view in the finder, you can resize columns by positioning the mouse pointer over over the thin line that separates column panes, and dragging it to the left to make it narrower or to the right to make it wider.  to make the finder remember the new width, hold down the option key(⌥) while dragging the pane separator to the desired width.  the best documentation i can find on this from apple alludes to the fact that holding down option resizes "all columns at once" but does not explicitly say that this makes the change persistent.

when you create a script in applescript editor and then save it as an application, there is an option to show a startup screen, as shown in the image below:    when that option is enabled, when you launch the script in the finder, it will first show that initial dialog before continuing.  as long as the applescript script-application in question wasn't saved with the run only option (see the image above), you should be able to open the script in applescript editor by dragging the script-application's icon onto applescript editor's icon

os x used to come with a version of apache ant, but not since os x 10.9.  i think that previously i must have installed into /usr/bin directly from the apache site but that is a bad idea because on upgrade anything apple doesn't recognise in /usr/bin is removed (although a copy is moved to /library/systemmigration/history/migratio**********/quarantineroot).  instead i should have installed into /usr/local  i did this using homebrew, installation of homebrew and then ant with homebrew was easy and i did not have to manually setup any paths, however note if you need to install custom jars they need to be put into (i.e /usr/local/cellar/ant/1.9.6/libexec/lib) libexec/lib which is non-standard, there is no libexec folder in the standard version of ant

there's no need to turn your ipad's wifi off.  you might save some battery life by turning off background refresh.  general &gt; background app refresh &gt; toggle all or some off   but it is my personal opinion that the ease of use that you gain from not having to log in and out of the wifi is worth keeping it on. 
you can also use the wayback machine

as a workaround i found out the following: if i switch off 'live updating', then sync my ipod, terminate itunes, disconnect my ipod, restart itunes again, and switch playlists, i can switch on 'live updating' again, and it seems to work.  if then (after "fixing" one playlist) i go to a different 'live updating' playlist, i just disable, then enable the 'live updating', and the playlist seems to work again.  this is very tedious, but better than recreating the playlist from scratch every time.  i'd be very interested in hearing other experiences.

airport hardware doesn't have this sort of feature but you could easily accomplish this by running your own dns on a computer or outsourcing the issue to a provider.  i believe you could also rely on an inexpensive router that did have this feature (or one where open source software was readily available) to run your dns and let the airport handle the rest of the tasks on the network.

you need to add a -v2 for yosemite
tricky one, but you can rig up a solution - i'm not sure about the final quality though.  first, you need to allow your ipad to use airplay mirroring with your imac as the target device.  to do this, you need to use a program like airserver ($15 for a single user license) or reflector ($15 again, but has a trial at least) or airmac (free, but not as fully featured) or airplayer (similarly beta)
unfortunately, neither microsoft's own client nor the popular cord alternative currently support it, and the latter likely won't for a while.  i haven't tested it, but the €20 itap claims to support it. 
i didn't find any way to modify the style of the selection, but you could use ui scripting to select a font from the format bar.  tell application "system events" to tell process "keynote"     tell pop up button 1 of window 1         click         click menu item "menlo" of menu 1     end tell end tell   you could assign shortcuts to the scripts with fastscripts or by creating automator services. 
what you want to do is:   toggle the zoom locate the rounded rectangle at the bottom of the zoom window(the one you use to move the zoom window around)  tap that once(without dragging)   tap "resize lens"   use the classic resize tools  tap outside of the window to save the configuration.   hope that helps! 
to make the settings permanent try adding something like the following lines to your .vimrc file
i've managed to get pretty far on my own, so i'm posting an answer
currently the port on the macbook pro is both a displayport and a thunderbolt port
according to the wine appdb, running itunes under wine is an adventure in itself
look for settings → phone → show my called id
figured it out: pressing f9 (or fn-f9 if you're on a macbook or using a apple keyboard) when the screen sharing window is active will bring up mission control on the remote machine and you can switch between desktops and full screen applications.   
the best option is to reboot with the option key held down
if you terminate the java process with kill -9, the shell which called gets an error code back
 go to settings go to general go to keyboard toggle and disable auto-capitalization  
this can even be done in time machine:  choose the 5 tb hdd as only time machine backup drive (ok, my disks are smaller  ):    then exclude your internal drive by adding it to the excluded items - the backup drive is excluded automatically:    the final result:  you get a folder backups.backupdb with one folder vm (the name of my mac) containing folders (with date names representing the backup date) and each with two folders representing the two drives (data1 and encrypted)
you can block the warning with an app called pop-up blocker, but if you are charging with too much juice, it's on you if you fry your ipod.  you can also look for an app called "resupported" if you are having problems with video out cables. 
the server admin tools and associated documentation will walk you through how this works on mac os x
unfortunately no, the automatic filling takes place during sync, and only gets changed in size if you add/remove things that will also take place during sync.  if you want to limit it while also preserving some of that randomness, try creating a smart playlist that will select songs at random, and then tweak the "limit to" feature until you have enough space free
for being that the phone is going to look like the 5s, but have hardware similar to the 6s, it would be safe to say that it means "special edition" since apple is going out of the naming convention(s). 
you can use the create booklet utility1 which adds an option to “print”, from preview or any other app, to generate a second pdf file with the pages arranged appropriately to print and bind as a booklet
since your screenshot references java where the app name usually is written, it suggests that it's the command-line version of java that a given app is trying to run.  if it appears at specific intervals, it either an app that you have open or a periodical job running automatically in the background (which, ironically, could be the java updater itself).  a quick way to check out which of your installed applications use java is to run this command in terminal (/applications/utilities/terminal.app):  find /applications -type f -name *.jar   this isn't 100 % accurate but it can give you a rough idea
@patrix's answer is right.  i had this error as well
there is a way! if you go to your settings > general > reset, there is an option to reset the home screen layout
i've solved my system wide stuttering with mountain lion by now (first sound only, mostly, then aggravated system wide).  here's why: my macbook pro became unbootable from stock hdd.  i had a bootcamp partition, no luck when booting into windows too, got stuck when booting, jusk like when booting into os x (got stuck at apple sign with spinning wheel).  i've got a ubuntu dvd and started a live session, smart disk diagnostics: 258 bad blocks, imminent disk failure.  i half apologize apple in this point, for blaming solely the os for being just weird
removing divx and divxupdate  if you'd like to remove the divx app along with its divxupdate, you need to uninstall the software.  uninstaller  uninstaller you can find in /applications/divx folder and run uninstall divx for mac.app.  manual removal  if above folder and uninstaller doesn't exist, just remove:  /library/application support/divx/divxupdate.app   to remove the associated launchd services, check first which one are registered by this terminal command:  launchctl list | grep divx   then disable or remove them
this totally will not work
you should probably use another app for screensharing and messaging
a friend just said:      i'm on a mac but i shell into a remote server and run irssi in screen, most   people i know do that
not true - mean sure can install apps from dmg.  the lion remain a full-blown os, with all common functions, like terminal.app, root access, developer system, and so on
to sync your iphone via wifi your iphone needs to be connected with a cable to the macbook once
if you are comfortable with applescript, you should be able to get it done using this web page as a starting point: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070813135408868  otherwise, you can export one or more cards in the vcard format, open that up in a file editor and it looks like a properly separated name field looks like this: "n:smith;joe;;;" so if yours look like "n:joe smith;;;;" and you are comfortable with regular expressions you should be able to work out a search and replace that would look for 'n:(word1) (word2);' and replace it with 'n:(word2);(word1)'
upgrade to the latest version of logic pro and try running the program in 32 bits mode (at least for testing purposes).  do a "get info" on the /applications/logic pro and tick the open in 32 bit checkbox.

as asked and answered on stackoverflow, there's an easier way to do this that doesn't involve making a new file system in a disk image file:  move your existing file aside, commit that move, then move it back using the case you'd like it to maintain and commit
yes, bash (the default os x shell) has the ability to customize the prompt in many ways.  $ps1 is the the shell variable for the main prompt.  try typing echo $ps1 in the command line and it will show you how $ps1 is currently configured.  if you just want to remove the the host name you can set $ps1 to \w \u\$ (note there is a space after the $) (i.e.$ps1="\w \u\$ ")  if you want this to happen every time you login in you will need to add export $ps1="\w \u\$ " to your .bashrc file.  there is extensive information on setting the ps1 prompt with other options in the man bash page. 
if you want to delete old versions from a document directly:   click besides the document name in the window title to access the version history time-machine like view opens, with document history on the right hand side clicking on the same menu as in step 1 in a history version will allow you to delete just this version option-clicking will allow you to delete all history versions at once  
if the app is a driver or some kind of system hack, then you better read it's documentation or contact it's tech support team to find out how to uninstall it.  for most apps, simply quit the app and drag it to the trash.  most mac apps won't create much extra "junk"
unfortunately you cannot push apps and media to your appletv 4th generation.  the only way to install apps currently is via the appletvs (tvos) own app store
turns out that the problem was that the disk wasn't empty
like everything else you purchase in the mac app store, you can install lion on all of your macs after buying it once
one option is to use the zoom function from the accessibility options
edit 2 sorry, misread the question.  your system preference pane is probably locked
from the command line you have to find the unix executable and run it using sudo like so:  $ sudo -u bob /applications/firefox.app/contents/macos/firefox    … or the same with su: (however this also needs you to set up a password for root - which i do not recommend)  $ su bob $ /applications/firefox.app/contents/macos/firefox   (…or the above in one line:)  $ su bob -c /applications/firefox.app/contents/macos/firefox     in the past, the easiest way for ppc macs was to use pseudo, but it has been long discontinued
go to system preferences, then accessibility

to enable cmdÖ -> \ just remap the key combo with karabiner
if you like xml, you might consider turning on debug mode.   does the lion app store have a debug menu?   if not, use spotlight to find/move to trash all kindle apps and partial downloads, reboot and try again
go to system preferences &rarr; mission control and uncheck automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use.

do you mean like an item in the menu bar? for that:   open system preferences  go to the keyboard tab shortcuts tab click app shortcuts click the + icon follow the instructions hit add   i hope that helped. 
afaik, everything in itunes is shared via home sharing
i'm not familiar with the particulars of your mouse and the associated drives, it probably hasn't been updated for lion yet, so i wouldn't expect any mission control options built in at the moment
i just solved this problem (on a system that was not running postfix) by changing the authentication method on one email account from password to md5 challenge-response. 
that's basically the only way unless you have one of the older mac pro's with the raid card
i'm not aware of a solution in spotlight with(-out) tinkering.  it certainly would add a lot of "trouble" to users with hdd as the the amount of file to index will be too much - hey, after all it's the / directory..
tl;dr - it's safe to delete in whatever way you choose.  the only conceivable problem would be if time machine was trying to prune a backup at the same time you were deleting, so maybe turn off time machine for the duration of your clean up if you're not using the built in delete button.      you can use tmutil delete in lion to safely delete backups
your question seems to boil down to "how do i contact support to resolve billing-related account issues?"  which has the easy answer: http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/account/  i'm not sure about the long path you took to get to that question though. 
you can restrict your app to devices having certain capabilities
these files starting with a dot are meant to be hidden in *nix.  to see them in terminal add the -a flag to the ls command:  ls -a   to see them in the finder you will want to set a hidden preference (this is global change tho, you'll see all your hidden files everywhere):  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles true   and then restart the finder:  killall finder   to reverse and hide them again:  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles false &amp;&amp; killall finder   source  update to add:  lately i've only been able to get this to work when the string com.apple.finder is lower case!  i think this happened starting in 10.9, but not certain.  so you'll want:  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles true;  
take the path that you used for --prefix= during your ./configure and sym-link that into the cellar/ directory that homebrew is using
as for your question, is there anything new that hasn't been done before, then one could be generous and say that the no-account-required and it-just-works is quite nice, as is the elegant use of front or rear cameras and the ability to switch between them, and the automatic landscape/portrait modes

alright, here's how i got rid of - flac files having those ‘click to play' icons and their ensuing endless 'preview loading' spinning wheels. - flac files with those quicktime/itunes style music icons   we don’t want either because at least in 10.9, neither quicktime nor finder nor quick look can play them (even with perian installed)

select the sent folder for gmail in the mail.app sidebar (might be under a [gmail] heading in mail depending on how you set it up) then go to the mailbox menu in the menu bar and look down near the bottom for the use this mailbox for menu.  choose sent in there and that should make the gmail-based sent folder the default place for mail.app to save outgoing mail

it took me a little while to find the "encrypt backup disk" checkbox, so i thought an answer explaining that may save you some time.  press the "select disk…" button in the time machine system preferences panel, and the  "encrypt backup disk" checkbox is enabled when you select a disk.   i decided not to encrypt my drobo after reading alrescha's important note about not being able to use an encrypted disk with older versions of os x than lion.  but i was curious to see if apple would warn me:   (see also "if i encrypt a time machine backup disk, is the entire disk encrypted or just the backups.backupdb directory?".)

this question has some suggestions for enabling the missing menu option (that question is about 10.7, but worth a try).  i think the command line version isn't working because you need to provide a final argument, specifying where to mount the shared directory locally
the fan speedup happens because normally the fan speeds are controlled dynamically in response to cpu temperature by the firmware (and as the cpus are typically underutilized, there is rarely or never any need to run the fans at anything like the maximum speed).  however, when the firmware is being updated, that dynamic temperature control is not possible - for safety the speed is just set to the maximum and left there until the update is complete.  this is true for all systems (even pcs - you will often notice a high fan speed for a moment when booting them as well)  so the real question is why is the difference between normal and maximum fan speeds is so great in the laptop (macbook) systems as opposed to mac desktop/tower/mini systems - and the answer to that is simply that the laptop hardware has much smaller clearances and therefore poor airflow without fans running
apparently removing the file ~/saved application state/com.apple.mail.savedstate resolved daniel's problem without resorting to a factory reset. mac os x is great for saving your progress but once in a while that savedstate file causes these types of problems. happy day!

unfortunately py32-scipy does depend on gcc4.8 as it depends on some c libraries which is a set of numerical routines that are optimised to run on your machine and so i think need to be compiled there.  normally macports does not compile but downloads precompiled binaries so you should not need to compile gcc48

unfortunately, itunes match really isn't made to be a backup service in this way, and it can be really easy to loose stuff if you don't have other means of recovering it.  for those songs you purchased from itunes, you should be able to still see them in the purchased list in the itunes store, and re-add them to your library

generally, the shared folders for a group should go in /groups/groupname/. /users/shared/ is more designed for local users to share, though there's nothing stopping you from using this too other than it is non-standard. 
you probably need to step a level further down the tree of software and hardware, to the level of kyremap4macbook - which acts as a filter between the physical keyboard and the keyboard events reported to macos.  the software keyboard map is an optional thing - software can intercept keyboard events at a level that bypasses it, if they wish, and it sounds like some of what the browser does with key binding is touching on that.  a lower level remapping may bypass that problem.

i just today found an article explaining the escrow service for icloud keychain.     if icloud keychain is configured to use 4-digit icloud security code (which is a default) then there is additional icloud service involved: "escrow proxy." in a nutshell, escrow proxy holds encryption keys to the keychain items shared via icloud and provides those keys to properly authenticated clients.   the problem with this, according to the article, is that the 4-digit code is then used to encrypt the escrow key

you can stop with this command:   $ launchctl unload com.wondershare.mobilegodaemon   additionally if you want to completely delete it, you have to search for it on /library/launchdaemons/, /library/launchagents/ and ~/library/launchagents/ to delete the configuration file, that should be called com.wondershare.mobilegodaemon. 
actually this is possible!...  use the following instructions: 1
 create a new folder somewhere accessible by all users. symlink a number of executables into that folder so that only the executables that you want to be accessible in all user accounts are in that folder.  ln -s /opt/local/yourport /path/to/your/folder/yourport  add the path to your new folder to the top of /etc/paths

i haven't found any actual answer for my question, but instead found a very good alternative.  basically @icloud.com accounts also allow the creation of aliases that can be used in all ios mail apps, with one particular advantage: the alias allows changing the name of the recipient as well, something @outlook.com account aliases does not allow.  you can create @icloud.com aliases using the web interface options. 
my understanding is that there currently is not one, although rumours abound that one is coming up soon

the straightforward way is to wait until the current version of ios is jailbroken, and then upgrade and rejailbreak - there are applications you can use (a handy range is described at http://www.cultofmac.com/169467/how-to-backup-your-jailbreak-apps-and-tweaks-from-cydia-ultimate-roundup/) to back up the 'jailbroken bits' of the device, but i personally prefer just upgrading and then putting back on those cydia apps that i really want on my own - they way i also have had the chance for a bit of a clear out

if you open up the settings app, you can choose what the "caller id" looks like for both imessage and facetime.  choose to start new conversations from your mobile number if you don't want to accidentally message them from your email.  it's likely you aren't even divulging the appleid unless you initiate a new message to them, and again - knowing that doesn't really loop them in to your private matters unless you also give them your password/passcode to the phone itself. 
i haven't been experimenting with this for long enough to be an expert yet, but i think you're confusing two semi-separate features: autosave and versions.  autosave saves frequently -- in textedit, it seems to save after about 30 seconds of inactivity

this is almost definitely caused by a setting in your system preferences:  maybe you have the new trackpad (or a macbook) in which case this part of the system preferences might look a little different, i know trackpads/laptops with 3d touch probably have some variation in regards to the appearance of the trackpad preferences, but it must be a setting thats analogous to the setting near the top left in the above picture, 'look up &amp; data detectors'

it thankfully seems that this was a temporary issue, probably due to the increased load on the apple servers on mountain lion's release day.  i am now able to download the command line tools as before so it seems the issue has gone away.  alternatively, if you're still having problems, this link worked for me when the "install" button in xcode didn't.

this works exactly as one would expect it to: when you share from an ios 8 device, purchases made with the apple id used on that device for purchases (itunes, ibooks, appstore) — even if that id is different from the one used for icloud (photos, mail, contacts, calendars) on that device — will be shared.

the (all users) is a clue that the system has been instructed to make all users have this item and it's not something you would add or remove from a user account.  you could browse to /library/startupitems and just remove the bamboo (or potentially wacom) items by moving them to trash or uninstalling the software that put those items on the system.  to be complete, if there are other users on the mac, they may need to re-add that program if they want to use it
in my experience, the cover photo is simply the first photo in the album

if you are suggesting new features or enhancements, try:  http://www.apple.com/feedback/  if you are reporting bugs, try:  https://bugreport.apple.com/  if you need to discuss extensive changes or a new direction you believe apple should take, i suspect you will have to apply for a job with the department you believe your ideas will have most value in, and then find those who make the design decisions, and convince them that your ideas are the best direction going forward.

to switch between windows of the same application, use ⌘ + ~.  if you need a shortcut like the windows' alt+tab that switches between all open windows, you can set one in your system preferences -> keyboard shortcuts as shown below.    as you can see above, the default is ctrl+f4, which actually means you need to press ctrl+fn+f4 because of the special meaning of the function keys

first, open the trash can by clicking on it in the dock. in the finder, press command-shift-g (go to folder) and go to ~/.trash in the finder window for .trash, click the proxy icon in the title bar of the window and drag it to the sidebar. you then have a trash folder in your sidebar.  to empty the trash from the sidebar, open automator and create an application. as the sole action in the application, select "run applescript" and use this applescript:  on run {}   tell application "finder"     empty the trash   end tell end run   save the application as "empty trash", and drag it to the sidebar. 
you tube sends html5/h.264 video to safari and devices that are unable to reproduce flash video, however, certain videos (those who have ads and some other features, as far as i can remember)) are still not supported by youtube in html5 format; that explains why you might experience some problems when using safari and seeing an embedded video

not exactly a solution, but some observations that might provide a clue:   issue also seen on my mac mini (mid 2011 - 2.7ghz intel core i7 + 8 gb ddr3) after upgrading from lion to mountain lion quicktime no longer saves the recording to ~/movies/screen recording.mov, but instead saves it to some temp location and when done recording, you need to save/export it. downgrading quality to medium quality didn't help   [update 11/17]  even my new macbook pro retina 15" has this issue.  i happened upon a tutorial that showed someone using vlc to screen capture on a mac and decided to give it a try
the first answer given by steve chambers is actually right.but in my case the answer would be try to get some backup from other mac and backup the os from time machine so that you can install osx with the backup faster and you just have to format the drive.and after that partition the harddisk and use a win 8.1 dvd to boot (press and hold the alt button when booting up the macbook).and this will install win 8.1 in mac without bootcamp

turns out that the format i used for the appleenabledinputsources entry was bad because it considers everything as type string, but keyboardlayout id must be of type integer!  so the correct way of doing this would be via xml:  defaults write com.apple.hitoolbox appleenabledinputsources -array-add '&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;inputsourcekind&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;keyboard layout&lt;/string&gt;&lt;key&gt;keyboardlayout id&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;15000&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;key&gt;keyboardlayout name&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;usinternational-pc&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;'   after running that command and doing a logout/login, looks like things work fine.

there is already a question on super user on how to install adobe cs products on case sensitives partitions :    you can copy over an existing install on a case-sensitive filesystem and rename all the folders so they match. or follow this procedure which seems to work with cs5.5, cs6 &amp; cc
the only official source, if you have lost your original os x dvds is to purchase one from the apple store  later models have the hardware tests built into rom, earlier ones must use those on the dvd.  if you've got a [physical] apple store near you, they're usually quite obliging for that kind of thing. 
the best approach is to use the repeat with action with the lines in file option selected
confirmed by myself on my new ipad mini 4 and itunes 12.  if you select "set up as new ipad" and hit enter you'll get a new window with "sync with itunes" message and a blue button with white letters get started. after hitting this button you'll get a itunes window for your attached device with all the relevant information, backups and other options.  in other words, if you select "set up as new ipad" * nothing is changed in the attached device * it is only attached to itunes for subsequent actions.

graphics switching is where the integrated graphics is switched for the discrete graphics when more performance is required (and where performance is more important than battery life &amp; heat output).  you can see the current graphics card that is enabled, and forcefully switch between the two, with gfxcardstatus.     integrated graphics should be used when you need battery life over performance (the integrated only option in gfxcardstatus can be used to force integrated graphics in circumstances where os x believes that the discrete graphics is required). discrete graphics should be used when you need performance over battery life (this is usually not required to be set manually with the discrete only option since os x is happy to switch automatically). dynamic switching uses the default os x graphics switching.   when 'automatic graphics switching' is disabled in the energy saver system preference pane, only the discrete graphics is used. 
it actually works the same as in the itunes store:   
since you have two other dns addresses listed, you can click on the entry for 192.168.1.1 and click the "-" (minus) button to remove it (although it may not have any practical effect on connecting to sites).  the ip address 192.168.1.1 is your default gateway and is the address of your router or modem that you connect to for internet access

the answer is that i seem to have encountered a bug in the implementation of dual displays in mac os x 10.9.1 mavericks.  if i am using both the internal display and the external display at the same time, without using "mirror" mode, then itunes will not permit playback of the itunes hdcp-encrypted movie on the external hdmi screen.  however, there is a workaround: if i close the macbook pro's lid, disconnecting the internal display, so that the macbook pro is only driving the external display, then itunes will play the hdcp-encrypted movie on the external display over hdmi, in full-screen mode -- although itunes still displays the same error message saying that it can't play back!   this is quite inconvenient, because i want to use both displays at once, without mirror mode, at all times, so, for example, i can have apple mail and microsoft word up and running on the internal display while i'm watching the itunes hdcp movie on the external display

in any type of enrollment you cant change the sellers name, its permanent.  i would recommend you to contact apple developer support and ask them if theres a way to change it, if its not you`ll have to buy a new enrollment and transfer your app.  hope it helps!! 
you mean use the partition as a usb drive on an external scanner?  if you start the computer in target disk mode and plug it into the scanner with a usb cord, this may work.  if you're running mountain lion or mavericks, you can use disk utility to add a small, fat  formatted partition to your hard drive without erasing it or losing any data.  connecting that partition to an external scanner may prove to be trickier than installing drivers for a scanner.

yes - mac do not care if the boot drive is connected internally or externally.  i usually recommend installing the os on the new drive with it connected externally since you don't do the swap until after you know the drive boots externally, but the opposite order is fine.  now, if you have problems, it's going to be because of hardware issue (cable, or drive failure) or possibly the software isn't complete / correct.

manually cloning a recovery partition  this process worked for me on an external usb drive, but i don't have a firewire drive or encrypted partition to test with, but it should work for you.  requirements   existing recovery partition on your internal drive (or elsewhere). at least 650 mb of free space on your external drive (a previous version of this answer required more space, but i fixed the first section to only use what's required).   add new partition  notes: this process is not destructive, provided you have sufficient free space on your drive.   in terminal, run diskutil list
humm, this is weird, mine does ok, but i never tried with both on itunes..
the secure delete option was removed from el capitan, but as explained in this article, there may be some alternatives you may wish to use (see below for notes if the mac has an ssd).   you can use the disk utility to overwrite the free space on the drive;  diskutil secureerase freespace level /volumes/drivename   where;     in this command, change level to a number of 0 through 4, where 0 is a single-pass of zeros, 1 is a single-pass of random numbers, 2 is a 7-pass erase, 3 is a 35-pass erase, and 4 is a 3-pass erase (note all non single-pass options may take a while to complete).   you can consult the man page for more detail on the command usage. overwrite the contents before the deletion (from the terminal);  rm -rp /path/to/file-or-folder   where r is to recurse over the folders and p will overwrite their contents. the srm utility provides a mechanism (from at least yosemite) to overwrite and remove files, lifehacker has an article on its use;  srm -v ~/path/to/file.remove   the -v indicates verbose mode

as pages was not really developed with producing pixel-based graphics in mind, i think you workflow is already quite the best way to handle such a task in pages (+preview).  however, if you have pages, you may also have keynote? your task could be accomplished with this app much easier.   slideshows are set up in pixels, not cm. after creating a new slideshow by selecting one of the predefined sizes, these can also be completely changed to custom sizes (info window, first tab). after finishing your artwork, you can directly export into several image formats like jpg and png

the best practice in storing app credentials is the keychain
your instincts are correct.  if a file is being modified when the program reads it, you will end up with a copy of it in a transient state (or perhaps some programs like iphoto that have a database that tracks files - the structure might not be correct to run with after a restore.)  this is why time machine makes two passes - it copies everything and then runs a second copy to pick up any files that were in the process of being modified during the first pass
to find aliases with mdfind, in a terminal:  mdfind kmditemkind="alias"  this will print a list of aliases with the fully qualified pathname.  note:  these are aliases created in finder, not symbolic links created with the ln command from a terminal or script.  to use find to find symbolic links created by, as an example, ln have a look at: man find  example: find / -type l  this will start in the root of the macintosh hd and traverse the entire filesystem that you have permission to read and output all symbolic links created by, as an example, ln showing the fully qualified pathname.  to augment the basic command example read man find.

you can use local tcp forwarding in ssh, for example:  ssh -l 2222:private:22 user@gateway   and then connect any of your graphical tools to the private server by connecting to localhost:2222, or just use again command line sftp:  sftp private_user@localhost -p 2222

you need to restore the device to install a clean version of ios and then re-jailbreak (ota updates simply do not work and using the update feature in itunes can leave behind data that will eat away at your disk space).  it is actually good form to set the device in dfu mode (rather than just hitting restore in itunes) and then let itunes take it from there

i have since solved the problem
i had this a long time ago, so i am not 100% sure that i remember the solution correctly, but i think it was rather simple:  rename the existing backup image or tuck it away in a folder. 
when you go to shutdown/restart, unclick the check box to disable the resume feature, which is likely what is opening all these windows (that were present upon shutdown).    if this doesn't do it, check that these applications are not in your user start up list.   
i recommend a nifty little utility called smartsleep that allows you to control when the saving of your ram contents to disk for the safe sleep / hibernate feature mac os x has.  alternatively you can disable safe sleep altogether by running: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0

you can use the terminal :   open ~/path/to/.yourhiddenfile -a /application/yourapplication.app   the hidden file are hidden by adding a dot in the beginning of the file name.  or with the good old gui method :    launch the application you wish to use to edit or view the hidden file. select ‘open’ from the application’s file menu. an open dialog box will display. with the dialog box as the front-most window (you can click once in the dialog box to make sure it’s in front), press command + shift + .  the dialog box now will display any hidden files or folders within its list items. you can toggle between the hidden files and folders being displayed by pressing command + shift + . again.  
by default, the spotlight gui in the finder will not let you use wildcards or other advanced syntax
well since you are using mac osx, when you plug in your phone you can do the following to back up your pictures outside of itunes.  step 1  open up preview with your phone plugged in
go to settings -> battery -> disable low power mode    low power mode will also turn off automatically once your device has been charged up to 80%. 
simply put: no, you can not change it.  this is because apple has designed it that way, and the only way of doing it would be going into the itunes files, and if you're lucky and find an uncompressed image and just changing that one.  otherwise, sorry but it isn't possible. 
we (the os x users) have been asking ourselves that question since the age of dawn.  very well phrased question to a sad response: os x doesn’t do that and can’t do it without 3rd party tools.  of the 3rd party alternatives there are a lot, i’ll just go ahead and recommend what i think it’s the best alternative to finder, but… your mileage may vary

yes - you can use automator to make a service for finder (or all applications) to perform rotation of images
yes, if you start typing, it'll select files/folders with what you type
in finder, you can just control - click (hold down control on the keyboard, then click the mouse / trackpad), and from the menu that pops up, select cleanup by -> name, or however you'd like to sort the items. 
since it's a folder, hold down the command and option keys, then drag the folder off the bookmarks bar

this applescript code will toggle the state of the "use grayscale" checkbox in accessibility under system preferences in os x yosemite (tested under 10.10.4) regardless of what was last selected under accessibility as it tells system preferences to open directly to the location of the "use grayscale" checkbox and toggle its state.  tell application "system preferences"     activate     reveal anchor "seeing_display" of pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"     tell application "system events" to tell process "system preferences"         click the checkbox "use grayscale" of window "accessibility"     end tell end tell tell application "system preferences" to quit   the next issue is how you want to execute it

in the end, deleting all the offending track and re-downloading it was the only thing that worked
the answers in the linked article are correct (but maybe hard to find among all the other information there)
i figured it out:  i opened a terminal window and executed mount_ntfs similar to this:  mount_ntfs -s -o rw /dev/diskxsy /volumes/somemountdirectory   where:   -o rw is the crucial part and means use the readwrite option; -s means mount case sensitive; /dev/diskxsy represents the actual partition to mount (in my case /dev/disk8s5); /volumes/somemountdirectory represents the mount point.  
as the other answers mentioned, you can just add it to login items:    there is a bug (?) where mail is not hidden at login even if the hide checkbox is checked though
you can use startsound.prefpane which basically just sets the volume to 0 when you shutdown and then turns it back up after login. 
this is not possible at all right now. like you said, you can back out and go in again to dismiss keyboard. other option is to tap the 'edit' button on top right

your card seems sluggish because it is.  your particular pny sd card is rated at up to 60mb/s (megabytes per second) data transfer rate; which is approximately .5gb/s (gigabits per second)  in comparison, your sandisk has a read speed of 150mb/s or 1.2gb/s (sandisk does not provide a write speed).  basically, you swapped out a storage medium for another that, out of the gate, is at best less than 1/2 the speed than what you had originally
a quick solution is to use homebrew to install python into /usr/local/bin so that your pip can run against a user-modifiable python framework.  brew install python pip --version   disabling system integrity protection is also an option, but i don't recommend that for anything but professionally managed and fire walled servers where you have the manpower to manage intrusion detection or if you are a developer/sysadmin and need to test things with and without sip.  ls -lo /system/library/frameworks/python.framework/versions/2.7/ csrutil status   you will see that the restricted flag is set which cannot be removed even as root while sip is engaged.  using homebrew makes it possible to manage pip and python separately than the system provided version for little maintenance, little risk and easy maintenance. 
there isn't a limit to this (or there isn't yet a limit that is imposed by apple); you should be able to install ios apps that you purchase on all your ios devices (obviously using the same apple id)
try ctrlf2 - that should highlight the apple-symbol on the main menubar.  edit: the cursor keys and enter then allow you to navigate, drill-down and ultimately select an item - just as you can on windows.  also - can't claim credit for this, i learnt it here on the site! http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/183/mac-os-x-keyboard-shortcuts/185#185 
the versions are not embedded in the files, but instead get stored elsewhere.  due to the nature of how lion stores versions, small files get saved entirely, but larger files can track only the parts of the file that changed in fairly snazzy ways to reduce the chance that some trivial change to a very large file uses more than a trivial amount of version space.  when you mail any file, you don't send the version, just the last saved copy.  when you delete a file, the system checks and cleans out versions so you are generally never going to see a large amount of space tracking files that no longer exist.  if you are curious - this terminal command will tell you the sum total of the tracking and storage on your main drive: sudo du -sm /.documentrevisions-v100/  i have yet to see a mac with more than 200 meg of storage here, but post a new question if you ever find a bug or situation where this storage seems out of line

to set the path of an applescript script or app to a variable use the following code:  set thepath to posix path of (path to me as text)   example:  set thepath to posix path of (path to me as text) display dialog "the path to me is: " &amp; thepath     if you want the path up to the script or app set to a variable use the following code:  set thepath to posix path of ((path to me as text) &amp; ":")   example:  set thepath to posix path of ((path to me as text) &amp; ":") display dialog "the path to me is: " &amp; thepath

many people have tried to find the files for apple's spell check dictionaries but i don't recall any successes.  as for the language tab in language &amp; text, it really doesn't have anything to do with spelling as such, although the top item on the list can set the default spell check dictionary in some circumstances
not yet on a 2nd gen 802.11n express.  apple has published four different manuals on the airport express:   airport express 802.11n (1st generation) - setup guide   the three expresses prior to that were not 802.11n so perhaps that's where the three previous generations (and the 1st and only newer generation names have come to be) a tad confusing, no? 
map 127.0.0.1 loopback address to youtube.com or others except localhost may cause some problems.  so map any unreachable ipv6 address is more better such like:  200:2:253d:369e::    youtube.com

eureka! i found it!  the way i achieved this marvelous setup, was with a combination of a tiny applescript saved as an .app file, and the brilliant, free third-party prefpane app, do something when.  instructions:  set up up the first part of the process as linked to in the question, which will give the following settings in autoimporter (so that when you insert the iphone, it will automatically import them to the pictures folder):    now go to script editor.app (/applications/utilities/script editor.app), and insert the following code, which is what will open the pictures folder in finder (replace yourosxuserdirectory with your own user folder name):  tell application "finder"     open ("/users/yourosxuserdirectory/pictures" as posix file) end tell   click save or export and select 'application' as 'file format' near the bottom

review the firewall configuration of the authoritative dns servers for the ptr records of your (public) ip address.  in our case, when looking up the ptr records of the public ip address (123.45.67.89 for example) by using the reverse notation (89.67.45.123.in-addr.arpa) in terminal on the lion server:   $ dig ns 67.45.123.in-addr.arpa +short results in:  ns1.technotop.nl.  ns2.technotop.nl. $ dig ptr 89.67.45.123.in-addr.arpa @ns1.technotop.nl results in:  ; &lt;&lt;>> dig 9.7.3-p3 &lt;&lt;>> ptr 89.67.45.123.in-addr.arpa @ns1.technotop.nl  ;; global options: +cmd   ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached   in other words the dns packets were discarded by an intermediary firewall.  after whitelisting the ip adress of the mac os x server in the firewall of each authorative dns server, the "getandlockcontext: flock(servermgr_info) fatal time out" issue was gone. 
the key is your access logs

as andrew ferrier stated in the comments to the question, this is indeed a part of facebook's privacy settings
you could store ssh keys or store your password in the ~/.ssh/config file (see man ssh_config for details) but that would be kind of cheating since it's not really in your .command file.  you could of course script the addition (and optionally removal) of the entries needed to modify ssh keys or config file changes.  i would make a simple expect script - to wait for the password prompt and then enter your password.  #!/usr/bin/expect -f set bad_idea cleartext_passwords_are_insecure set timeout -1 # now connect using ssh spawn ssh user@example.com expect "*?assword:*" send -- "$bad_idea\r" send -- "\r" expect elf   you don't have use a $bad_idea variable and could just send the password before the \r 
in lion, there's a setting in system preferences under security &amp; privacy asking how long after sleep or the screen saver begins is the password required.   
the only visible change that jailbreaking does is the installation of the cydia app on your homescreen. what i would suggest is to go into cydia and get an app called poof to hide the cydia icon

itunes is the solution that apple offers to load content into ibooks if you don't want to perform that loading on the device itself.  i'm not aware of another product that does the same on a regular basis for easy set it and forget it syncing, but several others like phoneview can read and write to the space ibooks uses to store content on ios.

you can use -b option and use bundle identifier instead of using application name
it's a real-time scanning process by sophos anti-virus that scans your computer's running processes in the background.  the parent process is launchd so that when you accidentally kill the intercheck process, it gets restarted. 
no, you can't do this unless the website allows it
i'm not sure whether that is a true fix or not - however, that file doesn't actually reside in /library/frameworks/ it is symlinked from /system/library/privateframeworks/nyxaudioanalysis.framework to /library/frameworks/nyxaudioanalysis.framework  you would need to replace the original, not the symlink     the simplest way to get there is…   switch to finder  cmd ⌘   n   for new window  cmd ⌘   shift ⇧   g  for go to… copy/paste /system/library/privateframeworks/  hit enter drag the file in [you might want to copy the original to the desktop first, just in case] click 'replace'  
i fixed it.  the problem was a silly little one, which i so sure wasn't the case, i didn't even bother to look when i did think of it.  the nuc subnet mask was set to 255.0.0.0 for some reason
yes pretty much anything that can do a boot-able backup of mac os x, should be able to do a back up of mac os x server
it seems that the solution is the same one listed there under "troubleshooting"

create an automator print plugin that prints as a pdf-x.  open automator.app  select "print plugin" at the choose a type for your document screen  select "pdf" from the actions menu  drag "apple quartz filter to the pdf documents" to the workflow space on the right  when prompted choose if you want to create a copy of the original, add or don't add  in the apply quartz filter to pdf documents workflow, in the filter dropdown, choose "create generic pdfx-3 document".  choose file-->save  name whatever you like (pdfx)  this will add a workflow back that allows for pdfx again
so far it seems that there is no way to do this
alternatively if you have an external drive you can back up all of your user profile (all the drive if you want too...) and then once macos is reinstalled use the migration assistant.app to migrate all your settings using the backup as the source, easy peasy. 
thanks to you all for your help
you could edit out the birthdate information from those contacts you do not want to see in the birthdays calendar.  another way to accomplish this would be by manually adding the birthdays you do want to see to a new or existing calendar and then disable the birthdays subscription. 
yes, you can easily copy virtual machines between systems
no.  you cannot uninstall apps from within the app store.  how can i delete an application?   you can delete them like in ios:   open launchpad. click and hold the app you want to delete (or hold &#x2325;) delete by clicking on the x.   note: the x appears only for apps which have been installed using the mac app store. locate the applications folder where the app is located:   /applications or /users/my_name/applications drag the application to the trash.   note: this will only remove the application - this will not remove some other files which may be related to the app (e.g
"avian" was the project's 'code' or 'working' name so the developers chose that string over the other choices. 
to remove an item, just swipe your finger to left over that particular entry

(disclaimer: i haven't tried this personally.)  http://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/c3s1_icons.html  if i'm understanding this page of the refit documentation correctly, you should be able to take a 128x128 .icns image, name it "boot.icns", and plop it in /system/library/coreservices on the partition whose icon you wish to change.  (refit automatically searches for .icns images named the same way as the efi loader file

a simple click should do it
it turns out that there is one app that does not have a "sounds" setting, but still produces sounds and vibrations: calendar
you would have to use something like php, or a workflow.  there are no applescript dictionaries for preview
this can be done if you disable auto sync in device settings, and automatic sync manager.  for that however you need to sync the new ones by selecting and dragging to ip*d to sync
you can't.  keep doing the manual versioning series that you should always have been doing
you may already know this, but downloading/installing xcode from the app store doesn't actually install it
if you have access to photoshop, then i highly recommend iconbuilder from iconfactory
gps uses satellites to triangulate your position with great accuracy, however there are other ways to get a fix provided you can triangulate via other means
it's not a stock feature of the os, but you might have some luck with third-party add-on bettersnaptool, which mimics windows aero snap features. 
yes.  airplay is really a technology platform that allows for streaming media on a local network
to copy pdfs to your device you should use itunes like in this video  (just use itunes for windows). you can use ibooks to read pdfs on your device.  here is related question here. 
i have found this macworld post showing an applescript that you can execute to force that.     i have my desktop images set to change every 30 minutes in random order
after talking to vmware support, there are two possible solutions to this problem:   open your mac's system preferences, go to energy saver and disable the option "put hard disks to sleep when possible"

it seems that the setting is only available on the 3g model.  it does not exist on the latest version of ios (4.2.1) on the wi-fi model. 
after a great deal of testing, i have come to the conclusion that tab works to increase indent, but only if your master slide is configured to have bullets
i knew it was going to end up being something simple that i was just overlooking...  as i googled around more, some of the information i found contained images of the icons for the mounted drives

i do not know about a better solution than logging out of the apple store
well, i figured it out! our active directory is very large
this is so that you can load configuration profiles
safari uses webkit as it's rendering engine
no, the itunes account are country bounded
i'm afraid this isn't made possible by the s.m.a.r.t (self-monitoring, analysis and reporting technology) system that is used to provide details of hard drive operation, i was hoping to find a smart attribute that details the current 'park' status, but it seems that there simply isn't one, and as this is a low level activity that is fully handled by the drive itself without any os input i cannot see a way of ever retrieving the status as the value isn't available in the first place. 
if you have been using photos only since migration you can safely delete it
after many hours finding for something at least useful to my problem, i found a website called secrets, which provides a lot of common mac os "defaults write" commands.  anyway, thank tony and drfrogsplatless for giving me clarifications and tips that were helpful to me. 
you can connect it to itunes and disable voiceover or you can learn if you are using voiceover correctly
you can still access data from "dee's backup" by selecting "browse other time machine disks" from time machine's dock menu
based on this from an old applescript release notes on sandboxing…     when sending commands to a sandboxed application, such as textedit in os x mountain lion, parameters that refer to files must be of an explicit file-like type and not a bare string, or the target application will not be able to access the file
you need to run vlc.  in vlc, go to the video menu and the fullscreen video device menu and choose which screen you want to use for fullscreen video playback.   
i already use puntoswitcher which does the trick but it has some annoying bugs and it's  only useful for russian-speaking users because ui is only in russian

ok if you're a new mac user you really should start with getting to be acquainted with homebrew
yes, videos and photos are stored in messages and they take up too much space
this should help identify what is going on in johnny's answer, as well as answer the question of why this works on linux but not mac.  the problem lies in the fact that mac os x uses bsdtar, whereas most linux systems use gnutar.  you can install gnutar on a mac with homebrew, using brew install gnu-tar, which will symlink gnutar into /usr/local/bin as gtar.  if you install gnutar, then you can reproduce the problem using the steps in johnny's answer.  $ brew install gnu-tar ==&gt; downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/gnu-tar-1.28.yosemite.bottle.2.tar.gz ######################################################################## 100.0% ==&gt; pouring gnu-tar-1.28.yosemite.bottle.2.tar.gz ==&gt; caveats gnu-tar has been installed as "gtar".  if you really need to use it as "tar", you can add a "gnubin" directory to your path from your bashrc like:      path="/usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin:$path" ==&gt; summary   /usr/local/cellar/gnu-tar/1.28: 13 files, 1.6m $ mkdir test $ touch test/a test/b $ gtar -zcvf test.tar.gz test test/a # make the archive with gnutar test/ test/a test/b test/a $ gtar -ztvf test.tar.gz drwxr-xr-x adamliter/staff   0 2015-07-28 22:41 test/ -rw-r--r-- adamliter/staff   0 2015-07-28 22:41 test/a -rw-r--r-- adamliter/staff   0 2015-07-28 22:41 test/b hrw-r--r-- adamliter/staff   0 2015-07-28 22:41 test/a link to test/a $ rm -r test $ tar -xvf test.tar.gz # try to unpack the archive with bsdtar x test/ x test/a x test/b x test/a: can't create 'test/a' tar: error exit delayed from previous errors. $ echo $? 1   so obviously gnutar archives things differently in a way that causes bsdtar to choke on duplicates
there's a longstanding request for it at https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=68600  and an early implementation is at http://eric.bachard.free.fr/mac/aquavcl/patches/aqua_february2008/quicklook/  to install, place oooquicklook.qlgenerator from that site into /library/quicklook and wait a few minutes for quicklook to detect the new generator. 
you can set dyld_print_libraries=yes in the environment to have dyld print every dynamic library that it loads into the process:  $ dyld_print_libraries=yes /usr/bin/true  dyld: loaded: /usr/bin/true dyld: loaded: /usr/lib/libsystem.b.dylib [ ..
to finish this question: i had opened a bug report with apple
app icons are part of the application and not something easily changed by the user.  changing the icon will change the data the application hashses over for its signature and so some things will complain the application is corrupt.  icons can be changed by going to the application in finder and then choose show package contents
by now it is possible to down-grade your baseband - at least for the iphone 3g and 3gs (unfortunately not 4/s) - from the ipad's 06.15 to 05.13.04 (un-lockable) thanks to the great work of the iphone dev team:     the iphone dev team is happy to announce a baseband downgrade option in redsn0w for those who are using the ipad’s 06.15 baseband on the iphone3g or iphone3gs.      typically you’d have the 06.15 baseband if you unlock with ultrasn0w but updated your iphone baseband past 05.13.04
from apple support knowledge base...  time capsule, mac os x v10.6.3 or later: how to transfer your back up from an existing time capsule to a new one  for this process, you should leave your computer in the same room as the time capsules, or use one ethernet cable to connect your mac to the ethernet port on the existing time capsule, then use another ethernet cable to connect from the existing time capsule to the new time capsule.   configure your time capsule for your network
if you create a new account with the same name, it should prompt you to use the existing user folder. 
since 203.130.48.8-bj-cnc (subtype ip address) and 203.130.48.8 (traditional ip address) are "ip address" instead of "alias," adding them in host file will not do anything
i would suggest doing a dfu restore
simply go to settings -> mail, contacts, calendars -> your gmail account and turn "archive messages" to "off". 
upon further review it may be best to use a recovery to fix this issue. 
use the key code 19 command, because the keystroke "2" command simulate the key code 84 (numeric keypad) instead of key code 19.  tell application "system events" to key code 19 using command down   to know the key code of some key, download this application --> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/key-codes/id414568915?mt=12    but, you do not need gui scripting to select a tab in safari, use this script  tell application "safari" to tell front window to set current tab to tab 2 -- this select the second tab  
from a higher point of view (in opposite to the low level implementation) this is probably related to nsurl's bookmark capabilities.     a bookmark provides a persistent reference to a file-system resource
i actually found a really simple solution to this problem: delete the play button entry from usb overdrive and then it won't overwrite the behaviour and everything is as it was for that one button.  interestingly, this the play key is referred to by karabiner as consumerkeycode::music_play
nslookup, host, and dig are perfectly good dns query tools in os x, but they all query dns directly rather than going through os x's internal resolution system
you can only change what a right swipe does in ios
presumably, the office installer can modify/update the microsoft silverlight.plugin (which is installed in /library/internet plug-ins/), which safari and chrome could potentially be using.  it's primarily just a precaution against updating files which an application is actively using.  [edit]  after further investigation, it looks like it's actually the fact that the installer modifies the fonts in /library/fonts/microsoft/ which is the motivation behind requiring that several apps not be running
you can do it with terminal:  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2011/07/os-x-107-lion-getting-rid-of-character.html  extract:       a new lion feature taken over from ios is the "character picker", which generates a popup menu of accented characters when you hold down the base letter on the keyboard

there is a tool bonjour browser which will show you the connected devices on the current network
you can save all the app data to migrate to another ios device at a later date by backing the iphone up to itunes or setting up a free icloud account.  this will nicely complement your existing plan in case you forget something until after you turn in the phone

these songs are itunes purchases that are available for download but not currently on your iphone
as robin says, most people would go for os x server, because it has tools specifically built to do just this, providing you bind the clients to ldap.  aside from that, os x is designed hierarchically
the 1st sort column is sorted by when the file was added to the playlist
i had the same problem, this happens because the tv is still sending a signal to the hdmi port even when powered off so the mac still thinks that it's active
you can't do it until you renew your developer account.  but, i know a couple of cases where calling apple and explaining the case, apple renew the account for 10 days to let users delete apps (don't know about transferring, but you could try). 
you might use a script like this:  #!/usr/bin/osascript  tell application "finder"     make new finder window to posix file (system attribute "pwd")     activate end tell   the script above always creates a new window

one solution would be to use dropbox or icloud to hold/sync your notes and read them with a simple text editing or note taking app
modern and semi modern cd drives (usb) are 100% compatible with osx since they are really an ata drive, connected through usb.  bluetooth and lightscribe technology will be another story, but the drive, as a reader/recorder ought to work without problems
two easy things come to mind:   quicklook: just press space on the first photo and then use the cursor keys to navigate coverflow: press cmd-4 to switch the finder window into coverflow mode and browse through your pictures
in the finder in mac os x, press command-shift-g to go to folder
your mac mini has optical audio-out, which supports multiple channels.  apple has cleverly put a little optical transmitter inside the headphone jack (many macs have this, not just the mini)
as you can see in ifixit's teardown, the hard drive is located in the lower right corner
it won't matter as far as the software goes since lion runs the migration script one time only on your snow leopard data whether you migrate it in from a backup or it's there when you do the upgrade to lion.  from a human standpoint, i would encourage you to make a "test" account (pick a different short name to prevent conflict or confusion when migrating your "real" account later)   updating and testing lion lets you build confidence the lion is working on your repaired hardware.   run snow leopard updates to 10.6.6 at least to get the app store if needed install lion run all updates test lion in the test user
os x includes a command line tool called split
after the script has been created do the following :   find the source app with the icon you want get info of the source app (cmd-i) click on the icon inside the source app's info window (not the one in the big preview section at the bottom, if you have one of those; the little one in the top-left corner.) copy it (cmd-c) get info of the automator script (i.e., the destination app) (cmd-i) click on the icon inside the destination app's info window paste the icon from the clipboard (cmd-v)   this method works for every files in mac os x.   
turns out you can bring them back into your camera roll, or at least in a place where you can use them in 1se, just by copying them into dropbox.   copy your mov files into dropbox. install the dropbox app on your device. for each video, select the ellipsis icon and then export, then save video.  
looks like the "save as pdf" option in the print dialog just takes the document title (which is set to the document name by pages) and adds a .pdf suffix to it
does itunes recognize your iphone? if so, you can start (non-jailbroken), by just going to the summary page when its plugged in and selecting restore
the following hint on mac os x hints details a way to do this
firewire attempts to use "smart" daisy chaining, which permits links in the daisy chain to be off
safari (for ipod and ipad) keeps website cache only in ram, and therefore, once it runs out of ram, it'll automatically destroy an entire page, forcing the refresh, disguising itself as an auto-refresh feature
screen is the best way to do it
funny, i just did this the other day.  you can use disc utility to clone drives at any time (the "restore" tab, far right)
since you must boot windows 7 from the internal ssd, and since you also want to run mac os x from the same volume, i recommend that you concentrate on cleaning out your existing mac os x system and freeing up as much disk space as possible.  you should research on how to make the smallest windows installation possible, so you can create the smallest bootcamp partition possible. from what i can see, you could do with as little as 12gb if you are meticulous
yes, you have to create a new account
quoting from an apple support article about personal hotspot (emphasis mine):     when you connect a device to your personal hotspot, the status bar turns blue and shows how many devices have joined
the caching service is no web-proxy
you have the "group windows by application" option turned off – this tiles every window individually so that nothing overlaps (this is how exposé used to work in os x 10.5 leopard and earlier).  when "group windows by application" is on, the tiled windows are stacked in groups based on which application they belong to, and the application icon is overlaid on the group, as in your second screenshot.  to enable "group windows by application", go to the apple menu > system preferences > mission control and check the box. 
use the following terminal command:  sudo systemsetup -settimezone timezone   for a list of valid timezone values, use: sudo systemsetup -listtimezones 
there is an html5 app which will allow you to turn your iphone into a personal hotspot without any jailbreak or extra apps
everything in your iphoto library is stored in ~/pictures/iphoto library.aplibrary (note that the extension is hidden by default).  simply copy that file to whatever mac you'd like to move it to
there is a non-graphical setting you can try:  sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1   that would mean that you need to re-authenticate after sleep transitions to standby

you are right to leave media in the original location to help save space
simply create a new admin account by reinitiating the os x setup assistant:   boot to single user mode by holding ⌘s on startup with the external display attached.  wait a few minutes and then enter ("blindly"):  mount -uw /   wait a second or two and then enter:  rm /var/db/.applesetupdone reboot   in single user mode the us-en keyboard layout is used
update: i found a new solution
since i have a much newer system i couldn't accurately test with a 119 mb file as it took less then a second to copy in terminal
ugh, this is so annoying -- it is the height of designer/developer arrogance (in my opinion -- and i'm a developer myself)
the answer really depends on the model of your mac

have you tried repairing the disk permissions via disk utility?   if that doesn't work, try enabling the root account, logging in, and attempting to access the files
yes you can do it using an active hdmi to minidisplay port adaptor like  this  but as you can see it's not cheap  
i don't use casks much, but on my test machine i just tapped the cask infrastructure to see what it installs today
this is a workaround, as i couldn't find a hotkey or menu option to do this

here's how i eventually solved this problem
you didn't mention what keyboard, but on the apple keyboard:  f7 - restart current song  f8 - pause/play  f9 - skip forward  note that you need to have the box unchecked in osx that says use function keys as normal

third party developers can provide import functionality to health app via the normal health kit api on ios.  some apps scrape or use web api such as sync solver exist to get fitbit data from the cloud to the local health app on ios
short answer:  there is simply no way to do this as of ios 6 and ibooks 3.x
using the terminal, you can try deleting your dock preferences, then restarting the dock:  % defaults delete com.apple.dock % killall dock   this won't affect the contents of your dock, but it will reset the preferences that you'd normally edit in the dock panel of the system preferences.  edit: per comments below, apparently this does reset dock contents for some people, but not for others&mdash;not clear why. 
look under "more gestures" the "mouse" system preferences pane:   set it to two fingers or disable it altogether
you should really use google sync for iphone to have all the benefits of calendars (and even mail if you need it). 
the tool being used in the screen shot is "quartz debug"  it is part of apple's free graphics tools for xcode.  to get this app:   download xcode from the mac app store. open xcode and select xcode > open developer tool > more developer tools... this takes you to apple's developer download site
though i don't have a tool now, i guess it can be done in couple of ways
as the gmail app is a third party app not built by apple, it is not allowed to run in the background to check for mails
unfortunately itunes doesn't support selecting multiple applications, apart from manually selecting each one
it's actually named "icon\r" (you can verify this with ls in terminal) and indicates a custom icon for the directory. 
as an alternative to fn+delete, you can also use control+d to trigger a forward-delete, at least in most places
i solved this problem while writting question:  for some reason /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/toolchains/osx10.8.xctoolchain/ folder (containing xcode command line tools) is here: /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/toolchains/xcodedefault.xctoolchain  to fix the problem:  $ sudo ln -s /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/toolchains/xcodedefault.xctoolchain/ /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/toolchains/osx10.8.xctoolchain   greg bair suggestion for mavericks:  $ sudo ln -s /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/toolchains/xcodedefault.xctoolchain/ /applications/xcode.app/contents/developer/toolchains/osx10.9.xctoolchain   this creates symlink to the right folder. 
microsoft excel is available for ios for free.  downloading and viewing excel spreadsheets can be done once it is installed.  editing (including filtering) can be done if you signed in to microsoft's service inside the app
do not uninstall apple-distributed git. you can leave it as it is and run another version by having it in a directory earlier in path environment variable.  the easiest way to install another version on os x would be to use homebrew packet manager.  after installing it, you can run:  brew install git   homebrew (brew) will take care of all dependencies and configure the latest git version, however there is still a chance it will find a setting it cannot resolve automatically, so read what homebrew says at the end.  packages installed with brew do not interfere with system-preinstalled packages. it installs packages under /usr/local/cellar directory and puts executables in /usr/local/bin, so you just have to keep it in path variable in before /usr/bin. 
the quickest way is to use bash and awk syntax in your terminal.app  for file in `find /source/dir -type f | awk 'nr %10 == 0'`; do echo mv $file /dest/dir ; done     for statement introduces the bash loop, to iterate through a set of data where file is the variable

os x handles sudo and su identically to linux.  sudo is a command that, without any additional options, will run a command as root
yes - ccc copies by file and so will manage.  this was my original setup and worked
do you have growl installed? any other non-apple system preferences? it would help to know if there is anything different about your setup when you get the "voice from the past". 
when double clicking the home button and swiping two times from left to right on iphone, and one time on ipad, you'll find a volume bar which will precisely let you adjust the volume of the device to the level you want.

yes, greasemonkey or "user scripts" were the ones that popularized this.  for one option on mac/safari, please see http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20718/greasekit 
here's one way - i know it's nowhere near a "proper" solution, but i imagine it would work.  ps ax | grep "/system/library/coreservices/backupd.bundle/contents/resources/backupd-helper" | grep -v 'grep'  what it does is search the process list for the backupd-helper process, then filters out the grep command itself from showing up
os x applications are actually special folders which contain numerous smaller files, resources, binaries, localization settings, etc

healthkit is pretty smart with your data
the page you are referring to uses javascript to dynamically change content depending on reader's environment.  in case of os x it changes to n/a meaning simply: not available (or "not applicable").          &lt;span class="menupath"&gt;edit | find | find word at caret&lt;/span&gt;.     &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list__item"&gt;         use         &lt;kbd data-default="ctrl+f3" data-default_for_gnome="ctrl+f3" data-default_for_kde="ctrl+3" data-default_for_xwin="ctrl+f3" data-emacs="ctrl+f3" data-jbuilder="ctrl+f3" data-visual_studio="ctrl+f3" data-netbeans_6.5="n/a" data-eclipse="ctrl+f12" data-mac_os_x_10.5_="n/a" data-mac_os_x="&amp;#x2318;f3" data-eclipse_mac_os_x="n/a" data-intellij_idea_classic_os_x="n/a" data-xcode="n/a" data-resharper="n/a" data-resharper_osx="n/a"&gt;ctrl+f3&lt;/kbd&gt;         keyboard shortcut.   as for the shortcut itself you can create your own by going to system preferences -> keyboard -> shortcuts. 
it could be interfering with existing wifi network, you can use the airport command line tool to disconnect from other networks:  begin by linking it to a another location:  ln -s \   /system/library/privateframeworks/apple80211.framework/versions/current/resources/airport \   /usr/local/bin/airport   then, disconnect from the current network:  sudo airport -z   you should be running at about 10 mbps ! 
you can use these wonderful bash functions from @slhck at super user:  to connect to different vpns, have multiple vpns in network.prefpane.  function vpn-connect { /usr/bin/env osascript &lt;&lt;-eof tell application "system events"         tell current location of network preferences                 set vpn to service "univpn" -- your vpn name here                 if exists vpn then connect vpn                 repeat while (current configuration of vpn is not connected)                     delay 1                 end repeat         end tell end tell eof }     function vpn-disconnect { /usr/bin/env osascript &lt;&lt;-eof tell application "system events"         tell current location of network preferences                 set vpn to service "univpn" -- your vpn name here                 if exists vpn then disconnect vpn         end tell end tell return eof }   don't forget to change the name of the vpn.

flipping  byte flip and word flip will swap bytes or words. technically it works like this:  let's say we have a two byte value (hexadecimal): 0x3344  the number consists of two bytes, the lower one is 0x44, and the higher one is 0x33, so let's put them into two imaginary cells of one byte size:  [33][44]   now, flip the cells:  [44][33]   therefore byte flipped value will be 0x4433  same way with words, considering word consists of two bytes. let's assume we have a two-word value: 0x12345678  split them into two imaginary cells, now containing one word (2 bytes) each:  [1234][5678]   now, flip the cells:  [5678][1234]   therefore word flipped value will be 0x56781234  shifting  shifting shifts values bitwise. what does it mean?  let's take a very simple decimal number: 5 then, let's convert it to its binary representation: 101 then, let's shift it left by 1:  [101] &lt;&lt; [1010]   we basically moved the whole binary sequence left one position and filled the empty space with zero.  now do the same, but with shifting right:  [101] &gt;&gt; [010]   our number is 10 now

the only application i can think of is mobile mouse; its purpose is to use an ipone/ipod/ipad as mouse to control a mac.  one of its features allows to have some icons on the ipod/iphone that invoke some applications on the mac; by default, the icons shown on the ipod/iphone are the ones that appear in the dock, but you can select a directory containing the applications or the scripts you want to execute.      the last screenshot shows the list of icons shown when i select a directory containing other directories; when you hover over an icon, the application shows the icon name, in the same way the finder does
this should do it:    add columns to spotlight search results  quote:     using property list editor        if you are using property list editor, start by going to your user folder and then navigate to library/preferences

ok, so there's at least one solution:   establish a wi-fi connection using settings > wi-fi (switch on, etc.). log-in the iphone **using appleid* when prompted. disconnect cellular using settings > cellular > cellular data (switch to off). switch imessage on (facetime, etc.) in settings > messages > imessage. switch cellular data on by reversing step 3. switch wi-fi off if so inclined by reversing step 1.   that did it! 
you can use the open command:  open test.xlsx   or, to specify the application explicitly:  open test.xlsx -a /applications/microsoft\ office\ 2011/microsoft\ excel.app/   or even,  open test.xlsx -a "microsoft excel"  
there are still unexposed preferences for changing the default fonts and font sizes:  defaults write com.apple.safari com.apple.safari.contentpagegroupidentifier.webkit2standardfontfamily georgia defaults write com.apple.safari com.apple.safari.contentpagegroupidentifier.webkit2defaultfontsize 16 defaults write com.apple.safari com.apple.safari.contentpagegroupidentifier.webkit2fixedfontfamily menlo defaults write com.apple.safari com.apple.safari.contentpagegroupidentifier.webkit2defaultfixedfontsize 14   another option is to add a rule like this to the default css file that can be seleced in preferences > advanced > style sheet:  @font-face {    font-family: monospace;    src: local('menlo'); }   it makes font-family: monospace and elements like pre and code default to menlo. 
the most basic way is probably to use globbing:  find 
as described in disable the internal screen on a macbook pro or air in os x yosemite &amp; mavericks to prevent the mac from using the internal monitor the following command need to be run   # in osx 10.9  sudo nvram boot-args="iog=0x0"  # in osx 10.10/10.11 sudo nvram boot-args="niog=1"  # to undo sudo nvram -d boot-args   then restart. 
there used to a be a method where by you edited the itunes music library.xml file on the second computer to make your device think the two computers are the same computer
.bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.  when you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.  but, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt
i can see two options:   delete the jenkins user, create it again (with a unique uid this time), then repeat all the commands you used to create its files
yes, you can buy a sim-lock free iphone 4, such as the ones that get sold in the uk or in belgium and use them anywhere else in the world where iphones are supported by local providers
you need to include the following directive in your httpd.conf file:  addtype application/x-httpd-php .php   edit  to make this answer more useful for other the full configuration for php on apache2 is:  loadmodule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so   or whatever your path is your php module

the canonical way to test is plug the phone into itunes and restore it
you can add one on icloud or on your mac
you basically have three options for virtualization on mac os x:   the already mentioned (and free) virtualbox the first solution for mac (and arguably one of the best ones these days) parallels for mac the very famous vmware fusion, from vmware inc.   any of these will allow you to run a variety of oss under os x without resorting to bootcamp or repartitioning

apple says:  enable dictation commands  before you can tell your mac what you want it to do, you need to turn on dictation commands.     when you enable advanced commands, you can also create your own   commands by clicking the add command (+) button
you need to install xcode 4.1 from the app store, which will replace xcode 4.0 with 4.1.  when updating xcode to 4.1 you will get a message to quit itunes to continue the installation

transmit - the ultimate mac os x ftp + sftp + s3 app can do this.  another choice would be expandrive - sftp/ftp/s3 drive but i think transmit is the better option (i own both and am affiliated with neither).  there are demos of both programs available, so you can try both.  note that transmit is sold both through the mac app store and directly the developer (panic)
the following commands will show you all the external disks which were mounted upon your mac during the last 7 days (unless you modified the conservation limit of system logs):  grep mounted /var/log/system.log zgrep mounted /var/log/system.log.*    if you would like to increase your auditing possibility on this sort of event, here is the way (for the ones at ease with the unix talk):   open the newsyslog configuration file:  /usr/bin/sudo vi /etc/newsyslog.conf  change the following line:  /var/log/system.log                     640  7     *    @t00  j   with:  /var/log/system.log                     640  30    *    @t00  j   (which means keep 30 versions of my old /var/log/syslog files) save this modified /etc/newsyslog.conf.

from apple support: spotlight: how to re-index folders or volumes        from the apple () menu, choose system preferences.   click spotlight.   click the privacy tab.   drag a folder or an entire volume (your hard drive) to the list.   if prompted for confirmation, click ok.   remove the item or volume you just added to the list   by clicking it and then clicking the minus ("-") button.   close spotlight preferences.         spotlight will re-index the contents of the folder or volume.   note: dropbox specific information as an addendum to the apple support directions.  the above directions are the written ones from apple support however with an object like dropbox on the sidebar in finder do not drag and drop it from there, instead either add it to the privacy tab using the plus ("+") button or drag and drop it from your home folder
you are not privy to customer details from any of apple's app stores unless you are selling a subscription and the user opts in to sharing data.  other than requiring the users to make an account to play and working within apple's uuid / temporary device id framework, you have no realistic way to determine who is spending money or who is asking apple for a refund.  have your lawyer (or you if you're the business person responsible for agreements) look over the terms and conditions that explain when you do and do not get customer data.  barring that, you can always open a support ticket with developer support since you are a paid developer to ask them to look into any patterns of unusual sales for your specific application
this is actually still possible; however, a safe-guard to protect novice users has been added
afraid not
go to system preferences and navigate to accessibility.  disable "spring-loading delay."   
your question should be answered here :  osx 10.8 - how to keep a custom dock for all users that login  basically, you create your dock in your account, copy the .plist from ~/library to the system template lib and your're done. 
this hint at macworld recommends a bookmarklet that you can install that allows you to tap an image to display its alt text.  try that - works great for me on my iphone
you can re-download lion even though it has already been installed by holding down the option key before clicking purchased
yes, it is perfectly possible to have both statements coexist happily in .bash_profile
there is no native way to do that. 
so you went to your keynote presentation document file and used the finder to "show package contents" then you deleted the image files you found in there
you have a one-year old question in super user about this. it links to an apple forum page where you will be told to how to use index and transpose functions to achieve what you're looking for. the past special of excel is way easier but this function is not widely used so apparently dropped from numbers. 
you could also go system preferences > users &amp; group, right click on your username, click advanced options, and set the path of your home directory
right click on the file name in window bar. 
 just unlock (bottom left) the network prefs before hitting the advanced button. you have to enter a login name with admin rights and the respective password to do so
that setting is not working. this is apple's bug. i confirmed with apple support. latest watch os 1.0.1 still buggy.

   what causes the difference between my mac an my iphone, where my mac   can boot and become useful immediately after being plugged in, while   my phone needs a couple of minutes before it can even start to boot?   the primary source of power for a mobile device is it’s onboard battery
a lot of the  solutions (such as right zoom) for this are intrusive: they replace the current "zoom" functionality, with the "maximize" functionality your looking for

if you see a 3g at the top left it means that you are in an area which does not have 4g support.  when you are in an area with 4g (or, on verizon, lte) you will see that in the top-left corner instead.

there's 3 ways.   sudo defaults write /library/preferences/systemconfiguration/com.apple.captive.control active -boolean false just delete (or rename) /system/library/coreservices/captive network assistant.app add an entry in /etc/hosts containing 127.0.0.1 captive.apple.com  
keyboard shortcuts such as the "print document" shortcut are baked into the each application, so unfortunately it isn't something that is system-wide and can be disabled in one place
in all cases i have tested, ios recognizes epub files and will offer to send them directly to ibooks.  i have tested this from the email all, dropbox app as well as mobile safari.  other apps like evernote and airsharing also are able to receive my epub files, so if you are not able to do this, perhaps it's an encoding issue or something about how the files are being attached to the emails and not necessarily a problem with ios.   
i have been thinking the same since i learned about nvelo dataplex and recently i stumbled upon ssdcache  it looks like they are working on versions for mac, linux and windows. 
indeed, it will let you download the last compatible version if you already have the app in your purchase history
you can use http://apple.com/feedback or contact apple support for the itunes store to register that opinion / information about their music service. 
   to uninstall the citrix receiver for mac, open the   citrixreceiver.dmg file and select uninstall citrix receiver.      after uninstalling the receiver and rebooting the system, ensure   that the files or folders listed in this section have been removed   from your system
to search the pdf contents embedded in an email using grep you are facing at least one if not two challenges.  the first is that files embedded in an email are not preserved in their raw form and instead are encoded into plain text for transmission in the email message
are you talking about a bluetooth headset? to my knowledge, they are predominantly single ear because they are meant to substitute putting a phone up to your ear.  however, there does exist bluetooth stereo headsets that can handle music and make calls using their built in microphone
aw crud, there are all sorts of "move focus to" commands in the navigate menu that i somehow missed earlier..
the speech synthesis programming guide describes the embedded speech commands that you can use to adjust how the speech synthesis engines process your input text.  the [[inpt phon]] command enables the use of phonemes and phoneme modifiers.  for example, the following text includes a phonemic version of your chosen word  (select the text, control-click, and select speech > start speaking to hear it directly in safari):  if you don't like how i say "colossians", then perhaps you will be satisfied with "[[inpt phon]]kuh2laasuhnz[[inpt text]]".   this syntax is accepted by the say command in the shell and applescript (though you will have to modify the (above) use of single- and double-quotes to suit the string literal syntax of your chosen context). 
navigate to your applications folder, right click on any app, choose show package contents and navigate to contents/macos/
from man lp:         -o landscape   looks like it should do what you need :) 
yes you can, you can run one monitor from the normal monitor port and another from a usb port but you need a special connector which makes the air think it has a 2nd monitor attached
no ipod touches can show the battery percentage at the top of the screen (unless you jailbreak them)
workaround   while in finder (in any view) drag the column_folder/ to the finder's sidebar. select the column_folder/ from the sidebar switch to column view show view settings  you can see the view settings will now affect the intended folder  tick "always open in column view"; click ok remove column_folder/ from the sidebar   now column_folder/ will open in column view! 
the easiest command is to use terminal - it's under the utilities menu - and type the sw_vers command:  sw_vers   the output will be the version and build that runs when you boot to recovery which can be different than the version installed on your main bootable os x partition. 
if you're comfortable using the terminal, you might be able to figure out what the file is
   if i upgrade to ios 5, will i lose the opportunity to restore from one   of these old backups?   no
yes, in ios 8 you can set a limit to the time period of the messages
yes to both questions: you can plug in a mini displayport adapter at the end, and mini displayport doesn't care about rotation: os x handles that. 
you can do this with keyboard maestro. create a macro group just for excel, then create a macro that executes upon ⌘w which closes the window and switches focus to finder.                    
as @bmike has suggested above, apple has confirmed you'll need an apple tv to support remote access.  from apple's newly posted support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204893     control your accessories away from home if you have an apple tv (3rd   generation or later) with software version 7.0 or later, you can   control your homekit-enabled accessories when you're away from home   using your ios device.  
it seems you missed the "read me before downloading" section at the top of the 4.3 beta page:     devices updated to ios 4.3 beta can not be restored to earlier versions of ios. devices will be able to upgrade to future beta releases and the final ios 4.3 software.   according to apple, anyway, no, you can't revert to 4.2. 
no, not without jailbreaking.  if you're willing to jailbreak your phone, there is a tweak called switchertweak (no idea how they came up with the name) which lets you select which direction the app switcher goes in.  (note: if you have updated to ios 9.1, there's no jailbreak utility currently available for it and there is no way to downgrade.) 
some experimentation using the xattr command shows this:   label information is stored in the com.apple.finderinfo extended attribute, which every file should have by default. custom application associations are stored in the com.apple.resourcefork attribute, which not every file has. updating the finderinfo attribute does not cause the modification date to be modified. creating/updating the resourcefork causes the modification date to be modified.   the resource fork historically had a special place in mac file systems
found it-- turns out there's a whole different set of notification prefs in the settings app
there are two strong reasons, one of which i got from an apple engineer and the other of which has been implied by a few apple employees but not stated outright.  the first reason is that the ipad 1 simply doesn't have enough ram to do the emulation while rendering the retina graphics, particularly while animating them
ok, thank you batman for suggesting to edit the sudoer file
by default in os x mavericks, dragging a file into a folder that contains a file with the same name will prompt you for what you would like to do.  take, for example, these two folders: folder1 and folder2
you can use mpeg stream clip: http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html  simply open the file and choose to export it from the file menu in a format of your choosing, selecting the appropriate rotation in the selection box.  you can find out the current format of the video by choosing file > show stream info as to match the export to the input settings if required. 
it is possible, although not from apple themselves.  a company called owc seem to specialise in ssd upgrades for macbook's and have upgrades for your model available here  these particular upgrades offer greater speed and capacity to some of the stock apple ssd's from 2011
instead of changing a protected file, why not change your path so that the newer svn is called by your scripts and users?  that's best practice since you don't control the os but you control the environment
ok, the solution was not simple
 command ⌘-shift ⇧-3 will save a screenshot of the whole screen to your desktop
in late 2009, apple bought lala.com, a site that did pretty much what present day itunes match does.  it analyzed tracks you already owned, and allowed you to stream the ones you already had on your hard drive.  the way the technology works is by analyzing the waveform of the music file and matching it to an existing database of known song digital audio fingerprints
i have found a solution or an answer to my own question, so i thought i'd share it with everyone else.  everyone who has the same problem or who wants to know how to do this, check out the application called soundbunny
in system preferences, go to sharing and change the name at the top of the window.   
well, here are a few things:   1) that os x installation disk (10.6), will only install snow leopard for your 2009 mbp  you cannot use that disk for os x installs on other machines  2) generally, the applications disk is nearly useless
a simple solution is to use the mute switch on the side of the phone
you may have a non-issue that you're worrying about
you can do this with usb or bluetooth tethering on jailbroken ios devices using an app such as mywi
i enabled the finnish and swedish keyboard layouts and experimented with terminal on os x 10.8.5 a bit…   control-å generated ^] (u+001d) å (latin small letter a with ring above) is an unmodified key in these layouts. it is located where [ (left square bracket) is with us layouts. control-ä generated ^[ (u+001b) ä (latin small letter a with diaeresis) is an unmodified key in these layouts. it is located where ' (apostrophe) is with us layouts. control-- generated ^_ (u+001f) - (hypen-minus) is an unmodified key in these layouts. it is located where / (solidus, a.k.a
the official answer (which clearly isn't the one you want based on how the question is phrased) is no for os x 10.8 and earlier
i finally figured it out: i can achieve what i want by using the $argv array which holds all arguments that are passed on to the perl script via the command line
don't use that guide
yes (maybe).  there's an open-source kernel driver os-x-sat-smart-driver for mac os x that will work for some usb and firewire enclosures
there is no stand-alone application for flash player like most software, as it is simply a browser plug-in
the mac address is unique and a property of the actual network hardware (although it can be spoofed)
i've seen this attempted a couple times, each times putting faster clocked ram into a machine designed for something slower - same machine as yours, the white unibody.  it might turn on, but it likely won't boot - just hang at the apple logo. 
copy the file from another system or a trusted person's machine  if you have a second machine with a comparable build of os x installed on it, you can copy the file from it
yes, you are going about this the right way to determine your battery's remaining capacity and life
this works for both itunes apps and the app store on the mac.   log into your account via the app store account link. look for itunes in the cloud click the view hidden purchases link. select unhide next to the app you want back in the list.   items aren't deleted from the list, just merely hidden.   
there appears to be no way to do what i need. 
a cursory look at the itunes store reveals codetogo (itunes store link)
from this apple support article you can do it from your account.     if you find you have reached 5 authorizations, you can reset your authorization count by clicking deauthorize all in the account information screen.   the process works as follows        click itunes store in the menu on the left side of itunes.   if you're not signed in to the store, click the account button, then enter your account name and password.   click the account button again (your id appears on the button), enter your password, and then click view account.   in the account information window, click deauthorize all.        also note the following:     you may only use this feature once per year
the magic option key again: when you are setting up an account, don't click on create, but hold down the option key and the button will change to next - where you can continue to imap or pop, and it is recommended even with imap that you set up google not as a google account but through this, the last, unbranded choice in the internet accounts preference pane.  i have some hope this info will be used in the other zillion questions on the same subject. 
i do not understand why you want to store it in the ~/.rvm/bin/ as that is supposed to be used for ruby related things and sublime text is not really that.  instead place it in /usr/local/bin with sudo ln -s /applications/sublime\ text \2.app/contents/sharedsupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl  if you get that error using this, try to type it in instead
i have encountered this problem before, on the downloads folder, and on other folders
the only option i have found is in settings -> general -> background app refresh that shows all apps that are currently capable and enabled to do the refreshing
you should go for the 64bit version
answer from stackoverflow:     unfortunately macports currently (2.3.1) only supports that if you have the port installed, i.e
for each source/library item (music,movies,podcasts) you want to open with a shortcut, create a new applescript as follows  tell application "itunes" try     set view of front browser window to (get some playlist whose special kind is podcasts) end try end tell   replacing "podcasts" with "music” or "movies", and save it with to your ~/library/itunes/scripts folder (if this doesn´t exist, create it!), giving it an unique name (like "show podcasts","show movies").  next, open "system preferences">"keybaord">"keyboard shortcuts" and select "application shortcuts"
hold the shift key as the user log in process starts.  you need to hop on the shift key quickly if you enter a password right after pressing return, get on the shift.  if your account logs in automatically, look to get on the shift when you see the gray screen with the dark grey apple logo
i actually have found one solution:  net2ftp - a web based ftp client  usual warnings concerning (non-)confidentiality of data etc
things to try:   check info button in activity monitor - it may show you what this process actually is if it's spawning new processes, that looks like something got stuck in infinite loop you can also check the sample of the process (in activity monitor click on system diagnostics option -> sample process if you have such rogue process and are unable to kill it reboot should help (unless that is some malicious app doing it on purpose) if none of the above helps and you've installed some new app recently, try to uninstall it, reboot, check if it's still there and maybe reinstall check system.log (it's a regular file, you can check it using console.app, or any other terminal emulator app) - you can do  cat /var/log/system.log or start this command and check what is being logged: tail -f /var/log/system.log (ctrl+c to stop)

you can set the release date through itunes connect.  the app distribution guide in the ios developer documentation has a page titled managing your app in itunes connect, where the section changing the availability date of your app states:     use itunes connect to set a date when the app is available on the store
with thanks to input from markhunte and tetsujin, i came up with the following solution
i am answering my own question
after a lot of messing about i managed to get this working in two ways.   the first is by using the retina display manager i found on reddit. this gives a menu with all the available display modes, but try the second method first. screenshot 1 (warning, large file) the second i found after using retina display manager, to my surprise the displays pane in system preferences was reporting it was running in 720p mode. this mode is actually 1280x720 hidpi (2560x1440). screenshot 2 (warning, large file)   yay!  i was going to embed screenshots of these new menus, but they are now insanely huge due to hidpi mode, so i just linked to them instead. 
you'd have to be on the personal hotspot menu from settings
i had the same issue on my new mac, when i checked the history file ~/.bash_history i discovered that it was owned by root
it is a program that launches itunes whenever an iphone/ipod/ipad is plugged in
there sure is.  when you have a song selected, you can press &#8984; + return and it will allow you to quickly edit the song title. 
uncheck the date options in system preferences &gt; date &amp; time &gt; clock tab
to connect a network device, use the system events dictionary:  tell application "system events"     tell current location of network preferences         connect service "sprint 3g"     end tell end tell   assuming the name of the service is sprint 3g:    to disconnect, change connect to disconnect:  tell application "system events"     tell current location of network preferences         disconnect service "sprint 3g"     end tell end tell   once you've saved your scripts with names, you can use the terminal open command to kick off either script. 
solution is a terminal command with which you can control the sleep timer. i set it to 1 minute.  sudo pmset -a disksleep value   this still means the disk wakes up every hour for the time machine backup, and also every 15 minutes-ish for god knows what reason.  but its much better than before, just annoying that it regularly wakes up for a minute, which is distracting. 
quit mail, edit the .mailsignature file with a text editor changing the html to whatever you like then right click the file in finder and select "get info" then tick the "locked" checkbox

back up your ipad to your computer or icloud, and pull a factory reset on the sucker
there's a ugly way of doing it, as far as i know
set up two locations - one with proxy one - one off - you are an apple menu item away from the switch.    just select network, then edit the locations.   
alternatively you could import them in the mail.app on your new mac using the "mail" -> "archive" -> "import mailboxes" -> "apple mail" menu option and then choosing the ~/library/mail folder on your old mac (or a copy of that folder on an usb thumb drive, cd-r etc)

i was concerned i'd have to save these documents to my local filesystem, delete them from icloud, and then perhaps save them to icloud over again, but it turned out that simply re-opening the "waiting" documents, making a trivial change to them (such as deleting a character and then adding it in again), and then saving the file caused them to be synced successfully. 
since it is set for all users it should be in the  /system/library/startupitems   or in the /system/library/launchdaemons   correction thanks to @maximus that would be in the /library/launchagents  copy one of the above and paste it in the finders "go to folder"  alternatively hover the mouse pointer over it (while it is highlighted) and there should be a pop up with the location of that file. 
the .art extension files are most likely in a vector graphics format, which might be openable in adobe illustrator
this program shows all keyboard shortcuts that use the ⌘ (command) key, just by pressing and holding command. http://www.cheatsheetapp.com/cheatsheet/  it does not show shortcuts that do not include command, but is quick and easy to use.

no, itunes will not "listen" for music in a given folder (like the popular bt program transmission, which will load torrent files once they've been downloaded to a given directory).  you have to manually add music by dragging it in the itunes window or going through the file menu (cmd + o).  however, you could achieve what you are after perhaps with some voodoo in apple script
dscacheutil is probably the best way to do this
ios does not provide a shortcut for skipping directly to the bottom of documents, but there is a reasonable alternative, if you're not already aware of it: scrolling views in ios respond to swipe frequency, scrolling more quickly the more quickly and frequently you swipe the screen.  while swiping a long document, email, or webpage, try several long, quick swipes in rapid succession: you should notice the scrolling speed accelerate accordingly

have you tried booting from osx installation media? those have both a terminal (with diskutil) and the gui disk utility, which might start working as you're no longer trying to partition the drive you're booting from.  caution, from now on: here be dragons! make sure you understand what's going on before you start on this, you can't back out halfway! check your backups are readable!  if both versions of diskutil fail here too, stay in the installation media's terminal and get the raw partition table using:  gpt -r show disk0   what has likely happened is that the two partition tables, the gpt and the mbr, have gone out of sync

you can also enter the following in terminal:  defaults write com.apple.finder _fxshowposixpathintitle -bool yes then killall finder  this will display the full path in the titlebar.    to turn it back off change the -bool yes to no  or if you want to copy the text of the path you can drag the file into terminal. 
i am using screenflow for my video
i found this apple scripts web page with examples.  there is a line in this script for the change of interval time allowing you to specify it, and you can customize the rest of the script to your needs.  tell application "system events"  -- random rotation of a folder of images  tell current desktop  set picture rotation to 1 -- (0=off, 1=interval, 2=login, 3=sleep)  set random order to true  set pictures folder to file "mac os x:library:desktop pictures:plants:"  set change interval to 5.0 -- seconds  end tell end tell  
this is a good tutorial for beginning with "pf", because system preferences do not allow you to enter manual rules.  http://krypted.com/mac-security/a-cheat-sheet-for-using-pf-in-os-x-lion-and-up/   i used to use the very good firewall fronted "handsoff!" by metakine (but they sold it), where you can do what you like, but honestly i do not know whether there is a yosemite update for that.  update: https://www.oneperiodic.com/products/handsoff/

as others have mentioned, this discussion has some good tips for accomplishing this.  i have not tested any of these solutions as i still frequently use google chrome and do not want to delete these files myself.  if your library contains a install.py file:  python ~/library/google/googlesoftwareupdate/googlesoftwareupdate.bundle/contents/resources/googlesoftwareupdateagent.app/contents/resources/install.py --uninstall  or:  python /library/google/googlesoftwareupdate/googlesoftwareupdate.bundle/contents/resources/googlesoftwareupdateagent.app/contents/resources/install.py --uninstall  if your library instead contains a ksinstall file:  ~/library/google/googlesoftwareupdate/google‌​softwareupdate.bundl‌​e/contents/r‌​esources/googles‌​oftwareupdateagent.a‌​pp/contents/‌​resources/ksinst‌​all --uninstall  or:  /library/google/googlesoftwareupdate/google‌​softwareupdate.bundl‌​e/contents/r‌​esources/googles‌​oftwareupdateagent.a‌​pp/contents/‌​resources/ksinst‌​all --uninstall  test if it worked by running defaults read com.google.keystone.agent

here is my solution:   open the picture in preview (or open the html in a browser) cmd-a to select all, cmd-c to copy create a new signature and paste in the contents   i have verified that this solution works for local pictures and simple html snippets. 
you can use the menu go -> go to folder and enter the path of the folder you wish to see in the resulting dialog
you might also have videos visible in the video.app
maybe you could consider using sleepwatcher instead of the security.prefpane; it´s a unix utility you could use to force a logout (or anything else via applescript) after a certain period of inactivity.

if you quit the application and re-start it, that seems to resolve any devices that connect and get missed when you plug them in after the application has launched and enumerated the connected usb devices.  even if you have itunes and xcode and other apps running, i've not seen image capture fail to recognize connected devices if you restart the program and i have certainly seen it miss device connects on occasion when other apps are running and want to talk with an ios device. 
option-tab seems to do the trick. 
the journaled file system practically eliminates the chances that the filesystem itself will be in an inconsistent state after the next reboot
yes that is possible - you need to exchange the template file within keynote.  first, save the presentation you want to use as a the new template with a .kth extension

i dug around for quite a long time to find this answer and finally found out that under the info box, there is a drop-down menu in the info box under info>options:    and the drop-down menu allows you to choose where it will show up:    all that converting was done for nothing... 
setting aside whether you are actually done with the prior version of xcode (as older versions have some capabilities and older sdk that the newer versions no longer support - you might want to keep an old machine with an old xcode around if you are supporting legacy software products - but let's assume you don't care about anything other than making new programs with the newest xcode) let's dive in with the steps.  to prepare for the new xcode, it is easiest to uninstall all previous versions of xcode by following the uninstall documentation for each version you have installed.  for xcode 4.1 you will want to run the perl script to clean things up:  uninstalling xcode developer tools  to uninstall xcode developer tools on the boot volume along with the  directory, from a terminal window type:  $ sudo &lt;xcode&gt;/library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all     for the new xcode, the app store doesn't normally show the download progress so you must track it from launchpad or just by watching the /applications folder in finder
no, you can't do this
after it changes to a list, press ⌘+z.  it's a common routine for things auto-corrected by apps if you don't want them to be auto-corrected, same with ms office for windows. 
are you sure that the file is an actual zip file as you will get this message on a file that has been renamed as .zip when it isnt in fact a zip file.  the only real way to tell is to use a hex editor such as 0xed to check the first few bytes are the characters pk. 
you can use imagemagick's scale or resize operators.     imagemagick® is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert   bitmap images
i have to start by saying that there is nothing wrong with using halt or shutdown from the command line.  in fact if you issue either of those commands then any running applications will get exactly the same message from the system as if you chose "shut down..." in the finder.  the advantage of using sudo shutdown is that you can shutdown the system regardless of which users are logged in. 
file -> export and set the kind to original  this will yield an exact copy of the photo you imported.

the proper way is to:   boot your mac to recovery mode by holding cmd+r at startup go to utilies and terminal in the menu type csrutil disable and enter restart normally and change your icon   repeat the procedure to re-enable system integrity protection (sip or rootless) but this time, enter csrutil enable  that's it ! 
i need to preface this by saying having not worked with .ts files i do not know whether or not they can be simply concatenated using cat and as you saw because the are numerically named they get mixed up when using cat *.ts &gt; masi.ts because it sorts lexicographically, so using a ordered list is in order
if you start terminal, enter  sudo defaults write /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.notificationcenterui keepalive -bool false   and restart, this did the trick for me in mavericks. 
make sure that your partition scheme is guid, not master boot record (mbr) or apple partition map.  to enable encryption, the partition map must be changed to guid
the lock rotation and the mute under the use side switch to: act as radio buttons.  selecting one deselects the other.  depending on which one is selected determines what the side switch does.  either mute or  mute or lock rotation.  the side switch is either on (showing an orange dot ) or off  (not showing an orange dot )  in mute mode:    side switch on = silent  side switch off = sound   in lock rotation mode:    side switch on = no rotation side switch off = rotation   the control center's  (when you swipe up) button that is used for  mute or lock rotation will also change to either a mute or lock rotation button depending what is selected in the settings.  so you have full control regardless of how you are setup. 
the great thing about numbers is they offer a great how-to guide

this doesn't exactly answer my original question either (which is about an os x dashboard widget for accessing notes), but it is the most useful note syncing solution i've found so far:   you can now (with ios 4) sync notes over the air with any imap email account
the only surefire way to avoid having javascript trap keyboard input is to disable javascript in the browser.  i understand you'd like to leave javascript on, but it is designed to pass near total control of raw key presses to the browser and not to the app once the os hands it input data
finder  finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of apple operating systems
theres no way to do that as of now, maybe that feature will be added later though

on your airport extreme you can block certain mac address for good with "no access".  in your airports configuration go to the "network" tab and check "enable access control", then click on "timed access control".    then on the top add the mac address you want to prohibit and give it a description
you can do a fresh osx re-install.  after that go into time machine and restore what you need. 
on ios 7   open the photos app and make sure you are in the “photos” section from the three icons at the bottom of the screen; look at the top of the screen and make sure the view is “moments;” now you can tap individual thumbnails one at a time to select them, or you can tap the word “select” that appears at the top of each grouping to select an entire grouping.     on ios 6   go to settings → general → usage → photos &amp; camera; swipe on the “camera roll” entry; a “delete” button appears.   this solution does not work on ios 7 (last tested on ios 7.0.4)

i am not sure, but does airfoil have a helper application running in the background? maybe you have to quit that one as well instead of just restarting airfoil?  also, do you have the latest version? i have just checked and the release notes on the rogue amoeba website have a bugfix in the latest release 4.6.2 from a few weeks ago that seems to match your problem:  http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/releasenotes.php     airfoil now disconnects from remote speakers upon sleeping, to prevent error messages on waking.   maybe that update can solve your problem? 
from man ls (the long format):     if the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.   or in other words: it works as designed. 
boot camp has to emulate a bios system, as windows requires this to run
short answer: no.  the i7 in the new 2011 server model doesn't support anything less than pretty much the original os.    sorry dude
for future reference i found a simple mac service that converts aliases to symlinks perfectly!  that solution actually wraps the script mentioned in the other answer as an automator action to make it easier to use by those unfamiliar with terminal.  to re-create the service, use automator to create a service that receives selected files and folders, select the run shell script action, and paste pastix's script into the script area

i think what you need is:  set t to text returned of (display dialog "query?" buttons {"cancel", "ok"} default button "ok" default answer "")   if you want to do this from a bash script, you need to do:  osascript -e 'set t to text returned of (display dialog "query?" buttons {"cancel", "ok"} default button "ok" default answer "")'   i can explain it in more detail if you need me to, but i think it's pretty self-explanatory.  edit: if you want the result as a shell variable, do:  shell_var=`osascript -e 'set t to text returned of (display dialog "query?" buttons {"cancel", "ok"} default button "ok" default answer "")'`   everything you type between the backticks (` `) is evaluated (executed) by the shell before the main command

since the iphone doesn't use an x86 processor, almost everything you know about 64-bit versus 32-bit will not apply
option + wifi menu  hold the option key down and select your wifi icon in the menu bar ( &#x2325; +  ).  additional information in the menu includes “channel:” and (5 ghz) or (2.4 ghz) for the current radio settings.  as seen in yosemite:    wireless diagnostics.app  you can get even more information from system information
i was able to resolve this issue by opening the file in numbers for ios (synced via icloud) and making some modifications
the app store found in itunes is only for iphone/ipod/ipad apps
there are two solutions, depending on the situation   create a computer-to-computer network
you could take advantage of the fact that 44 is evenly divisible by 5.5 and use an inner and outer loop:  repeat     keystroke "i"     repeat 8 times         keystroke "o"         delay 5.5     end repeat end repeat   note that for the keystroke command to work, you need to be in a tell block for the system events application. 
it sounds like the settings aren't getting saved properly
it's not possible to use ram running at 1600mhz in your macbook pro 8.2, because it's not supported by the processor.  your macbook pro has the intel® core™ i7-2635qm processor which only allows ddr3-ram running at 1066/1333mhz according to intel
indeed @cksum appears to be correct
you don't need a dedicated machine, as server can be installed on any machine providing it meets system requirements without much change to the actual system, unlike the older osx-server, but it's probably a good idea.  i have installed server.app before on my mbp to test some features and its worked fine for this
ios apps can only read data in their own directory and thus only safari would be able to use these files - so how could you create them and put them in safari's directories?  from apple's filesystem basics development documentation     an ios app’s interactions with the file system are limited mostly to   the directories inside the app’s sandbox
ntfs-3g from macports works perfectly fine
the first thing to be aware of is that itunes uses a unique "library persistent id" to identify the pairing of an idevice to an installation of itunes
yes, google chrome has a sandboxed built-in version of flash.   download chrome. navigate to: macintosh hd> users> guests right click and select "new folder" and change its name to applications open the google chrome disk image and drag chrome.app to this folder   google chrome and its flash player will only be accessible to the guest user. 
you're looking in the wrong section. photos &amp; their sync options are in the main summary section for that specific device    click the device icon in the header bar to get there - you get a drop menu if you have more than one device, otherwise it just switches...   
i would look into using handbrake, the ilife suite is good for some things, but not this scenario - it will let you create and edit films that are already in a decent file format, or burn them to a dvd, but not take from a dvd with ease (or at all).  while it is possible to snip a portion of a dvd, it's not desirable for a number of reasons, mainly file size

in /library/preferences/ add a plist entry to the file com.google.chrome.plist such that the key is incognitomodeavailability and the value is 1.  here is an example: assuming the file com.google.chrome.plist doesn't exist, use a text editor to save the following code:  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;!doctype plist public "-//apple//dtd plist 1.0//en" "http://www.apple.com/dtds/propertylist-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;    &lt;key&gt;incognitomodeavailability&lt;/key&gt;    &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;   the full file name and path of the above should be /library/preferences/com.google.chrome.plist.

hp doesn't make any ios apps with this functionality, no - have you tried opening the printer's webpage in safari on the ipad however?  none of my officejet 6500 or 4500 printers can run the scan functions from their status pages, but perhaps your model is slightly different. 
i have both the magic trackpad and the magic mouse, and imo the trackpad works really well for browsing, navigating in the general system, and is a very natural way to interact with the computer.  that being said, it is not precise enough to be used when you need to do  photo/video editing, and in those rare occasions i use the mouse.  i also do programming, but barely use the mouse/trackpad when i'm coding.  pros:    very easy to navigate in pages (web browsing, preview, etc.) enable one to use the built-in gestures, and that make a huge difference in day-to-day computer usage ideal for an "htpc" usage of your mac : i frequently casually use my mac from the couch, and not having to move a mouse is a definitive plus.   cons:   precision doesn't fully replace a mouse you'll miss the gestures as soon as you'll use a different computer.  
i have now solved this problem by deleting my user account and creating another account with the same name (but a different uid) using the original home directory.  some folks at apple support were baffled by the problem and said they hadn't seen anything like it
solved!    solution:    the network i was trying to connect to, was set not to distribute it's id, so i typed it in or saved it somehow at some point
this is done the same way with external or internal drives.  start your disk utility (applications -> utilities -> disk utility)
resetting the pram works the same way it always did
yes you can!!!   open the mplayerx preferences window by pressing &#x2318;+, or via the menu mplayerx &#x2192; preferences… go to the advanced tab in the preferences window. in the textfield with the label extra options enter -loop n, where n is the number of times you want to loop.  
you could use qlmanage  instead.  /usr/bin/qlmanage -p file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf   this will open the files in quicklook.  you can then use escape or the space bar which will close the quicklook previews and be back in terminal since it is the active app. 
i'd also suggests bettertouchtool, a fork of multiclutch, which allows you to remap a tons of multi-touch gestures.  moreover the program allows for windows snapping (a là windows 7), and keyboard shortcuts.  it's definitely worth a try. 
sourceforge is having issues right now
windows had changed the hd partition map from guid partition table(gpd) to mbr
on the mac you can use automator to set up a folder action for this
an insufficiently-powered usb port will charge an ipad, just slower than a high-powered one
you can't, actually
you could easily achieve this using mount_smbfs (which is, actually, a wrapper for mount -t smbfs) :   mount_smbfs //user@server/folder ./mntpoint   optionally, add the workgroup :  mount_smbfs -w workgroup //user@server/folder ./mntpoint   you could, of course, change the ./mntpoint (for something like /volumes/smb).  after doing this, simply go to ./mntpoint to browse your data.  to unmount, using the following command :   umount ./mntpoint  
for the usb, you will have to go to the extreme trouble of plugging it out, and then back in i'm afraid  for the ssd, you could try and open up disk utilities, and the volume should be greyed out on the left, all you need to do, it select the volume, then click the mount button on the top
these troubleshooting steps helped me resolve this on one account:   delete all pairing records in bluetooth (or at least all ios pairing records) and then power down the mac
the mac mini sends out digital video through hdmi or the thunderbolt port
as a workaround, you could log into the admin section for each ap and look at the active connection list. 
the characters included in the popovers are defined in property lists inside the /system/library/input\ methods/pressandhold.app/ bundle.  i was able to change à to y by editing /system/library/input\ methods/pressandhold.app/contents/resources/keyboard-en.plist and logging out and back in.  (note the escape in "input method" if you're copy pasting)  &lt;key&gt;roman-accent-a&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;direction&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;keycaps&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;a y á â ä æ ã å ā&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;strings&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;a y á â ä æ ã å ā&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt;

unlike for mac os x, apple does not release "security updates" for previous versions of ios after the next major version has been released, unless it is an extremely major vulnerability
according to the ifixit teardown (see step 19) the microphone is indeed located above the camera behind the mesh
it turns out that, as i suspected, a paranoid security configuration was preventing afp from working.  in particular, the machine had been "hardened" per apple's security configuration guide in which chapter 9 describes how to disable afp by unloading the com.apple.afpfs_afpload dæmon (i had thought it was only required to serve files, not also to connect to an afp server as a client)
a coworker pointed out an inconsistency with my email account and that led to the resolution of the issue
my suggestion  don't try to resize from the recovery partition
i don't know of any safari extension doing this but you may use automator to create a folder action attached to your preferred download folder sorting files according to their extension or kind to various folders
yes, you don't have to keep that folder according to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2780986?start=0&amp;tstart=0  /edit  it's the backup of old xcode installation. 
it seems to be possible to unlock restricted movie content on request through your apple tv, but through your iphone or ipad it appears not to be possible
to see a listing of all the apps you have purchased or downloaded, do this :   go to store > view my account login click on "purchase history"   you should now see all the apps you have downloaded before.  stolen from caliban's answer here. 
you can find a description of commands/settings allowed in /etc/nanorc by running man nanorc
you can move your itunes library from your pc to your mac
this annoyed me too, and it doesn't seem the solution is entirely satisfying — we'll just have to hope that twitter for mac gets updated soon to be better compatible with lion.  if you have "swipe between pages" set to "swipe left or right with three fingers" or "swipe with two or three fingers", then left/right three-finger swipe gestures will work in twitter.  if you have mission control &amp; app exposé set to "swipe up/down with three fingers", then you can hold ⌥ option to use up/down three-finger swipe gestures with twitter
the answer i went with was to contact apple's support
nope
 open the mac app store (/applications/app store.app) download the os x mavericks app. run it from the /applications folder if it doesn't automatically run. follow the instructions.  
the files appearing read-only to you is probably only because you are currently not their owner. &nbsp; &nbsp; what's likely happening is that the synced files retain the numeric owner-id from the source machine, and since that numeric uid in this particular case corresponds to the account macports on the target machine (in both transfer directions), macports has become the owner.  to verify that your account on each computer has the same numeric uid as the macports account has on the other machine, type the commands id -u and id -u macports in the terminal in your account on both computers.  fixing the cause of the problem  when information was submitted that the syncing is done using synk pro, i had a look at the synk pro web site and the app, and in the 'advanced' settings i noticed the "ownership:" option, which by default is set to "copy if possible". &nbsp; &nbsp; since it looks like synk pro transfers files' numeric uid, and there's no option for mapping this uid to another uid/account on the target computer, the way to make synced files be owned by you is to change the "ownership:" setting to "ignore".    fixing the files  to fix the permission problem for the already synced files, you only need to change the owner of the files to your own account
though apple doesn't provide the info on their website, there are a number of tools that allow you to easily find what cpu is being used.  let's take a look at the highest configuration of the imac 27" 5k for our example.    apple's website lists a 3.3ghz quad-core i5 and a 4.0 ghz i7
mkalias is a binary available in a set of tools here
yes you can, drop them into itunes or email them to an account you can check via the ipad
why use linux for this? just do it in os x
in my experience for mountain lion, determining which display is the primary display is usually achieved by dragging the white menu bar (circled in screenshot below) onto the graphic of another display, thus setting the other display as the primary monitor.   
seems like a solution is to hold home button + volume down + screen lock until device forcibly reboots
this homebrew readme gives these steps (with links to more information):     contributing      in short:         fork homebrew.   brew create http://example.com/foo-0.1.tar.gz   git checkout -b foo   git commit library/formula/foo.rb &amp;&amp; git push   pull request.         in long:         formula cookbook   acceptable formulae      homebrew formulas are written in ruby (currently, the version of ruby 1.8.7 bundled with os x 10.9)
to enable the finder to show all files (including "hidden" ones), you can type the following command in at the command prompt in terminal:  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles -bool yes; killall -hup finder the first part sets a hidden preference so the finder shows all files; the second part restarts the finder so these preferences take effect (killall on its own tells a program to quit; the -hup flag asks the program to restart).  if you want to reverse this so that the finder now hides the files it normally hides, type this in terminal:  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles -bool no; killall -hup finder  if you are more comfortable using the gui, there is a system preferences pane you can install called secrets that lets you toggle this setting any many more, but it involves installing third-party software on your system.  that said, your actual problem of disk space not being freed up when you "delete" files is actually by design.  to permanently delete a file, you need to empty the trash — mac os x doesn't delete files directly in the finder; it first moves them to a temporary storage on their original volume, and then when you empty trash… in finder, the files get deleted.  some users are reporting that defaults write com.apple.finder is not working on their mountain lion systems but defaults write com.apple.finder (note the lower case) is working
simple…   alt ⌥  right click &amp; you get the option to delete added to the context menu    alternatively - press  cmd ⌘   +  alt ⌥   + ← backspace see deleting songs on computer from an itunes playlist 
i found this tool called bettertouchtool http://www.boastr.net/     bettertouchtool is a great, feature packed app that allows you to   configure many gestures for your magic mouse, macbook trackpad and   magic trackpad and also mouse gestures for normal mice

iwork '09 apps don't seem to have an edit > substitutions menu, but in ones that do you can set up a custom shortcut for toggling the smart quotes item:   
all ios devices do that after they have been completely discharged.  if it does not boot up with in 5-10 minutes of being plugged in, then it could be an indication of hardware failure
afaik you can't use the adaptor/cable for this

unlocking the file  you can unlock files from within the terminal using the chflags command with nouchg:  sudo chflags -r nouchg bilder   according to the man page for chflags:   uchg is the user immutable flag no in front of a flag removes the flag: nouchg   preventing this from happening in the future  a general solution would probably be to avoid handling permission altogether and using ntfs or fat for an exchange partition.  however, i specifically voided such a solution (fat32) this time, because i encountered serious errors the last time. 
why disk utility does it this way is a good question, but when both the drive and volume show like this, its a corestorage volume.  these terminal commands should put it back to the old way if it isn't encrypted:  diskutil cs list - find the "logical volume" (not group) and copy the long "number" at the end of the line (it looks like this: be1e16ca-64e2-494b-8edc-3e843ef5c9a9)  diskutil cs revert be1e… - paste in that long string in place of be1e…  as always, ensure you have a backup in case things don't work out. 
judging from apple discussion threads (a quick search turned up these three threads on the first page of results alone), the global resume switch does not seem to consistently stop applications from saving and restoring saved state information.  if you only want to disable resume selectively for iwork, you may be best served by something like restoremenot or tinkertool, which has a dedicated tab for granularly managing resume besides its other tweaking features.  if you want to completely disable the resume feature, mac os x hints outlines a procedure to do so
this may seem complicated, although after you've done it a few times and use it regularly you'll have it down
you can look here for instructions.  essentially, set your preferred screen saver in the screen saver preference pane and run this command in the terminal to see the screen saver on the desktop:    /system/library/frameworks/screensaver.framework/resources/screensaverengine.app/contents/macos/screensaverengine -background &amp;  
after checking the system requirements on the adobe web site i could say: no, you can´t use adobe cs6 illustrator with your mac because of the lack of ram (1gb instead of 2gb) and no 64bit processor as apple said it on your support document. 
that would be the      ctrl-left or right arrow   to slide between full screen applications. 
free ram is wasted ram
when i recently installed os x 10.9.1 over 10.8.5 on my mid-2010 mac mini running windows xp in boot camp, xp continued to work fine in boot camp
i've just tried this, and the answer was unexpected...  when i created the image it was stored in the following folder:  ~/library/images/ichat recent pictures  
i'd rather throw them away
you are correct
1gb of ram will kill you: frankly, i can't imagine that it would meaningfully run
i dont think its that easy with default apache, not without the risk of it reverting on a software update, the config files would be in /etc/apache2 though  its probably simpler and more reliable to install something like macports and install apache2 from there, that way it will be persistent of apple software updates and much more flexible in configuration 
see where are keyboard shortcuts stored (for backup and sync purposes)? which mentions some relevant files in ~/library.  (also helpful: globally edit all keyboard shortcut settings  – which talks about manually adding/editing shortcuts.)  copying ~/library/preferences/.globalpreferences.plist from my old account worked, however, i had to log out and do it from a separate account, otherwise osx will undo any changes to the file. 
turned out it wasn't a problem with the certificate after all, it was that the application signature used by parental controls changed when the certificate changed

ok, i should have taken a look at superuser, here's a way to do what allinone says without fiddling with xml files (and it's faster). simply create a new smart folder or hit cmd+f, choose "raw query" from the filters and type kmditemusertags != '*' in the field.

when you use a vpn to send all your traffic to another network, you are reducing the ability of the internet to route your packets directly from your phone to the servers and instead are forcing the network to put the packets the vpn embeds to travel first to another network and then to the destination.  in the case where you need to hide / encrypt traffic, this downside is clearly worth bearing
yes, you can increase the standbydelay value:  sudo pmset -a standbydelay 18000   the value is in seconds, so 18000 is 5 hours

you can't remove several of the apple-supplied apps (try removing the ever-useful stocks app, for example).  the apple watch app is one of these.  generally, people tend to move these to a folder that they use to hide the 'useless' apps, or move them to a different screen - just so you're not staring at them all the time.  where i live, the apple watch is not even available yet, but still i got the app staring at me to remind me of this constantly

indeed, the screenshot does appear to have been edited.  the correct way to select multiple photos is to press the select button, then tap the pictures.  as far as i know, it is impossible to select images without pressing the select button, and pressing the button changes it to a cancel button, and the navigation bar title changes to select items (or the number of items selected), as well as removing the back navigation button.    on the left: apple's screenshot; on the right: how it should appear when selecting multiple pictures.

last night, i did a support webchat with apple uk about the issue, telling them the above.  they confirmed that those were the steps that they would have advised
this issue has been going on for years, and there is no way to "fix" it on the mac.  what happens is the machine gets an address from dhcp, and then performs a reverse dns lookup to see if there is a hostname associated with the ip in dns.  if you are on a windows network, all of the windows machines are automatically registered in dns when they connect to the domain.  i went on and on with the techs at apple about this..
in a word, "no".  the dock is dynamically sized as you have found on the basis of the number of applications stored, or running, and the amount of document windows you may have minimised.  there is no way to stop it exhibiting this behaviour, and if you think about it it would cause considerable usability issues if it were to do so, as the only way to maintain a static width would be dynamic resizing of app/document icons, which would eventually be too small to usefully identify.  if you don't like the overlap, then you can try a couple of workarounds:   set the dock to autohide open what you consider to be the maximum number of items in your dock, and scale the size down in preferences to make it fit in your "gap", then accept that a lot of the time it will be smaller, even it it shouldn't get much bigger than the gap. use a vertical dock to any change of size shouldn'f affect the width.  
you can use the finder to navigate inside the bundle, and then drag and drop the file to the 'open file' dialog/sheet.  see a more visual explanation here.

if you're running os x on a hdd then i don't see how trim enters the equation, since trim is only for ssds
my take on this is that apple does not want users to see icloud as another dropbox or (even worse) another idisk
while there are (too) many ways to setup multiple idevices on the same machine, the simplest way and most headache free is having a single account on all devices synced to the same machine
that’s certainly not a firefox sound, at least not one that i’ve heard in the past
tcpdump is a command-line utility to see the traffic on any network interface
the result pane displays the result of the evaluation so the easiest way to print the result is to execute:  math.round(5.0/2)   using console.log() does work from the command line:  osascript -l javascript -e 'console.log(math.round(5.0/2))'

this may be one of those things that is labeled as a "feature not a bug." it's possible that the swiping gestures that are the same as the gestures on snow leopard are considered "legacy" gestures
if you were running windows 7 before the reinstall, look for the following folders:  \username\my music\itunes\mobile applications \username\my music\itunes\itunes music\mobile applications  if you were running windows vista before the reinstall, you should look for:  \username\music\itunes\mobile applications \username\music\itunes\itunes music\mobile applications  if you were running windows xp before reinstalling, look for:  \documents and settings\username\my documents\my music\itunes\mobile applications \documents and settings\username\my documents\my music\itunes\itunes music\mobile applications  these are the default locations for your apps
by definition, the software only allows certain brightness levels so only by modifying that software (jailbreak or perhaps apple changes things) can you go dimmer.  there are many apps that use the colors and draw dimmer text (instapaper uses black background at night and many stargazing apps only draw in red)

the only way to do this with all file types is to create a service in automator, which actually should make things easier for you.   open automator and select "service". in the "service receives selected..." dropdown, change it to read "receives selected files and folders in any application" select utilities from the library menu in the left pane and double-click "run shell script" change the "pass input" dropdown to "as arguments" delete the default script and replace with the following:    if [ -f "$1" ] ; then                           open -a "textedit" "$1" ; fi   save this file as whatever you want it to show up as in your contextual menu, something like "open with textedit" and you're done, you'll now have the option to open any file with text edit

the mac chess app is based on the sjeng engine.  a page on the sjeng website says:     sjeng is probably a bit weaker in bughouse than it is in crazyhouse.   most sjeng's on the fics have a rating of about 2000 points in   bughouse, with a top of over 2200 points.      for standard chess, sjeng's rating is probably about 2450 elo [sic]. in   suicide and losers chess sjeng beats all but the very best humans, and   will beat non-specialized programs easily.   so, according to the makers of the engine apple uses, the elo is around 2450 in standard mode. 
the current version (itunes 10) will run on a powerpc machine but it has some small limitations (primarily it can not play high definition video from the itunes store)  system requirements:     mac computer with an intel, powerpc g5 or g4 processor   intel, powerpc g5 or 1.0ghz powerpc g4 or faster processor is required to play standard definition video from the itunes store   2.0ghz intel core 2 duo or faster processor is required to play hd video, an itunes lp, or itunes extras from the itunes store   mac os x version 10.5 or later   source (itunes download page)

no, as the first imac which allows this is the 27-inch late 2009 imac, as explained here.  there are, though, some applications which may achieve something similar, requiring both computers to be connected to the same lan/wifi/vpn, and sending all the information, the one to be displayed on the second computer working as a display, through it
at the moment, you can't really do this

if you can't launch or switch programs (i find spotlight is a good way to do this if everything else is hanging, just hit ⌘space, but it may not work in your case), you could enable ssh access ahead of time, and then use another device to log in and check what's hogging your cpu.  open sharing preferences and enable remote login

if you want to see the contents of one space in another space, there is no such feature in lion, and i'm not aware of any applications that may enable it.  all in all, such “feature”, if it existed, would have given me a bizarre feeling, akin to remoting into my own computer

at an educated guess, i would say the following is happening:  exchange is designed to push - and the exchange server is no doubt pushing to apple servers - regardless of whether you have push enabled on the ipad or not, it's just how it works
the picture in your question is referred to as an ac wall adapter, or "duckhead" (us) and slides out of the ac power adapter so you can then slide in the ac power cable (us), pictured in the link in your question.  the picture below shows the "duck head" being slid out of the ac power adapter and once removed the ac power cable gets slid in its place, thus providing an extension cord to the ac power adapter.

the most efficient method of deleting multiple voicemails at once on the device is using multitouch to swipe left on multiple voicemails at once, then tapping delete.  if your device is jailbroken, you can delete voicemails from the location that they are stored in (and the sqlite3 database in):  ~/library/voicemail/  
i would check the serial number (printed on the box or/if it wasn't replaced, behind the sim tray/by entering dfu mode and checking in system profiler or using the identify feature in redsn0w) and, if it is old enough to downgrade its baseband, restore it to the ios version you'll want to use° and perform the jailbreak+ipad baseband and baseband downgrade procedures.  °depending on available shsh, of course  seeing the poor condition of the existing system software you'll likely want to restore it anyway…

unless you've already found it, how about something like the mac hackers handbook? it seems to have been published in 2009 and references leopard in the description, so may also be a little out of date, but from the reviews seems to have a reasonable amount of information about security and os x internals
you do have to create a new shared album, but you can create the album from the contents of the existing album so you don't need to find the images again manually.   open the album. choose select in the top right, then select all in the top left. tap share in the bottom left, then create a new icloud photo sharing album as usual.   once you've created the shared album, you can delete the old album.

one solution i've come up with may be to convert the pdf document to individual jpg images, then sync those 'photos' via itunes.  they can then be viewed individually or as a slide show.  caveats are:   limited resolution once itunes downsamples the photos for syncing slideshow stops once you zoom in or manually disrupt it: ideally would like it to automatically continue (hoping there is a better slide show app to do this...)

i managed to install a raw printer driver and print to it from the command line.  using cups/gutenprint's web interface at http://localhost:631/ i added a printer with device uri      usbtb://generic%00%00%06/generic%20bulk%20device?serial=1234567890   and selected "raw" as the make for the printer
overall, there are generally not huge problems using another mac to install the os on to a target mode drive (same as installing to an external drive)
on os x 10.7 (lion):  smbutil lookup &lt;hostname&gt;   example:  $ smbutil lookup nas1 got response from 10.21.0.133 ip address of nas1: 10.21.0.133  
unfortunately, even the most recent release of itunes doesn't have a very good method for this.  you could use the mini-player option, either from the window menu, or toggle with option-command-m, but that is designed for album art - and won't show you the track info unless you mouse over it.  there are plenty of 3rd-party utilities, however
yes, the receiving company will need an apple developer id and membership of the mac and/or ios developer programs.  part of the process of enrolling involves agreeing to apple's terms of service and other legally binding agreements
your vdi path is wrong:     vboxmanage: error: could not find file for the medium   in your resize command either use the uuid of the vdi or a proper path (no backslashes!) :  vboxmanage modifyhd "/users/masi/virtualbox vms/ubuntu 14.04 64bit/ubuntu 14.04 64bit.vdi" --resize 10000   or (with backslashes but no quotation marks)  vboxmanage modifyhd /users/masi/virtualbox\ vms/ubuntu\ 14.04\ 64bit/ubuntu\ 14.04\ 64bit.vdi --resize 10000   or after entering vboxmanage list hdds:  #replace uuid and size below by the appropriate uuid and the required size vboxmanage modifyhd uuid --resize size     if your path doesn't work properly you may have to prepend /usr/local/bin/ 
the standard way of approaching these terms is to say that an "application" is a specific, static program on storage
terminal is limited in its configurability but iterm2 is a terminal replacement that does what you ask and more
here is one way to get webcal feeds to show up in outlook 2011 for mac if you are using office 365.   open the office 365 web application go to my calendars on the left and right click "open calendar" and paste your webcal url into the "from the internet" field the calendar (basecamp or tripit for example) will now show up both in your office 365 web app and also in outlook 2011 for mac (assuming you have this set up)  
generally speaking, you can only relocate a package (that is, install it into a different directory) that has been built with relocation in mind.  if the package supports it, it can be relocated with the command line equivalent of installer.app, conveniently called installer, with option -target (from man installer):     the target volume is specified with the -target parameter (-tgt is   accepted as a synonym).   the argument to -target is:   a volume mount point (/volumes/hdd), device node (/dev/disk0s5) or volume uuid (376c4046-083e-334f-af08-62fafbc4e352), for example:  installer -pkg installme.pkg -target /   any of the values returned by -dominfo (localsystem or currentuserhomedirectory), for example:  installer -pkg installme.pkg -target currentuserhomedirectory    (as you see, the latter command looks very promising
a dmg can be set to display a license agreement before it will allow you to open it

google chrome comes with its own instance of flash that runs only when it needs it and only within the scope of chrome
not sure if this is the best method, but there's at least one way to set a keyword to trigger stuff in spotlight, and that is by making an application with automator
i find it easiest to use the settings app on ios:   general about diagnostics &amp; usage diagnostics &amp; usage data scroll to the crash you care about and tap it select all, copy the text   now you can paste the report wherever you please
i could suggest something more evil :   enable parental controls and use the logs !   someone on apple support asked if private browsing disabled logging

first i tried tetsujin's answer: i looked in ~/library/safari/extensions to check but it was an empty folder besides extensions.plist and also /library/safari/extensions did not exist.  next i downloaded malwarebytes by recommendation of daniel azuelos, and when i ran the scan it said my computer was clean.  this virus i think is very advanced, for it would change the homepage and search engine of all of my browsers no matter how many times i changed it back
you can stop mac os x unmounting user disks on log-out
i just figured it out
the setting is in system preferences -> dock 
where did you install the “brightness” command? even if you've set up your path in the shell rc scripts, it may not take effect for these commands because automator isn't run from a shell
i think you would need two things in order to make this work.  1

 in finder, open /system/library/preferencepanes on lion for the system preference panes or /library/preferencepanes or ~/library/preferencepanes/ for user-added ones. drag the icon of your choice from the folder to the dock
/home is used as a mount point for the automounter (see /etc/auto_master and /etc/auto_home), you can't create your own directories in there.  if you are looking for a place to store common administrator stuff shared between different administrators, create a directory in either /users/(any admin account) or /usr/local/share and make it accessible to all members of the admin group. 
this can be caused by the default sound settings being changed
mac os has always had a multiple document interface
remove rating for one song  the app subler allows to edit a song's info manually
preview only works with pdf files and some image files (png, jpg, gif, tiff, bmp) so you won't be able to open a text file on preview.  to open your info.txt file from terminal you need to choose an application that can open text files, like textedit or any other text editor.  you also could use open -e file, to open any file using textedit.

how about  dscacheutil -q user | grep -a 3 -b 2 -e uid:\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'  
any person new to apple and mac would find lot of things un-intuitive or just forced on the user, w/o any options to change it. or it might be that just many of us had their first experiences on win/linux systems.  but just found this plugin to finder xtrafinder which among lot of other options allows you to enter/return to open a file.  feeling a lot relieved now! hope it helps.   
i have accomplished this by plugging it into itunes, selecting "back up to this computer" and hitting apply

with some care it can be done safely
with the looming possibility that any advice you get from here could cause damage to your machine, i'll prefix my answer with a disclaimer that you should probably confirm with an official source or advice from apple directly.  so long as the visible damage is limited to the insulation, you should be fine with electrical tape (as opposed to duct tape)
have you looked into software like touchcopy to transfer the videos? it offers a windows and mac version
custom syntax color themes are located in  ~/library/developer/xcode/userdata/fontandcolorthemes/   (note that this directory may not exist if you've not yet modified any of your themes or haven't created a custom theme of your own, but will be created as soon as you do.)  the files have a .dvtcolortheme extension
you can use screencapture commandline utility
according to this and other articles, yes, it does work! (and it functions just like any other audio input/output device — with any application that supports audio in/out.) 
this is the script of a similar bulk erase/copy routine i made with the help of klanomath in this related question - find specific attached disk, not volume, by applescript which you need to reference to see how the device name is extracted
one option is to first focus on an element that would satisfy the rule (this is because the rule list only shows rules that apply to the current element and the second you would input a rule that does not it would "disappear")  then you simply go to elements tab -> styles -> rules and click on new rule
a possible solution for your problem may be the creation of a bootable usb using another mac computer
as the arstechnia link to ycombinator page states, it is a "bug inside apples coretext font rendering framework".  this post on a russian website drew attention to it: http://habrahabr.ru/post/191654/  (translated page here: http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fhabrahabr.ru%2fpost%2f191654%2f )  the comments under the ycombinator article are the most interesting, with one reader pointing out that this bug is already fixed in mavericks  also, if i had enough reputation, i would downvote your question for putting an offending string in the question and thus risks causing a crash for some apple.stackexchange.com readers
you can ask siri that all you want, but she isn't (yet) programmed to toggle that switch for you
the clue came from the system log, looking at the entries from apple push services daemon (apsd):  apsd[69]: hardware serialnumber "system serial#" looks incorrect or invalid   it turns out that this machine had a logic board (motherboard) replaced a while ago by apple, and they never bothered to flash the machine's serial number

if you use vim before the installation, the file .vimrc should be on your $home directory (/users/your-username/.vimrc)
over the network it does not matter what file system is used on the hardware drive, because the computer hosting the drive (making it available through the network) will access it
user @patrix gave this suggestion which turned out to be exactly what i needed:  running ‘find /volumes/name-of-cd -print‘ in terminal will give you a list of all accessible content. 
the easiest way to this would be to simply create a folder in dropbox and then create a symbolic link to your music only folder in itunes.  there is a useful article on symlinks available here
simply drag the folder to the desired position in the sidebar

i don't know how i managed to miss this before, but it appears they are simply joined in alphabetical order   mywifinetwork mywifinwk2   1 will always be picked over 2  if you are able to persuade you're it staff to change the name (ssid) of the network then you can do this   mywifinetwork a_mywifinetwork   or    mywifinetwork02 mywifinetwork01   should make sure 2 is always connected in preference to 1 when both are available  i've tested this a bit, but i'll come back and update if it stops working
afaik there's no (free) onboard app to achieve this.  the easiest way would be to do it via command line.  zip /path/to/zipfile.zip file1 file2   if you want to add all(!) files within a directory and subdirectories, run  zip -r /path/to/zipfile.zip /path/to/dir   it will also add .ds_store files and that like, so be careful with the latter command.  however, if you're fine with spending some money, you could take a look at http://macitbetter.com

if you type the following command in terminal you will get all sorts of info on all the corestorage volumes currently attached to your mac, including the conversion status you are looking for:  diskutil cs list   there are more answers here.  one of my favorites is nick bedford's answer towards the bottom of that page that gives you just the status of each volume without all the other info.  diskutil cs list | grep -e "conversion" -e "volume name"  
option 1: use textmate 1:  open ~/library/application\ support/avian/bundles/themes.tmbundle/themes/custom.tmtheme -a textmate cp ~/library/application\ support/textmate/themes/custom.tmtheme \ ~/library/application\ support/avian/bundles/themes.tmbundle/themes/custom.tmtheme   option 2: edit the theme as an old-style plist from the bundle editor:    option 3: edit the tmtheme file directly by opening it with mate:  mate ~/library/application\ support/avian/bundles/themes.tmbundle/themes/custom.tmtheme   the last two options require you to close and reopen files to make them use the edited theme

i just found a app called inklet.  i did not try it my self, but will consider it for any pen drawing work where the use of mouse or trackpad is difficult.  it does cost $20, but it might be worth, but there is a free demo version to try first. 
what you want to do is add a network location for work.  you can then easily switch between them using the location submenu of the  menu.  if you really wanted, you could set up a script to switch locations based on network, but really, how lazy do you want to be? ;)

from my own testing, it seems to depend on how you delete the note...  if you delete the note on icloud.com:   you can easily recover the note by going to the trash folder.   if you delete the note on an ios device:   you can recover the note by restoring the device (if it's been backed up). you can recover the note from a device that hasn't recieved the latest sync changes.  
it's not possible..

it seems that the problem is that when you launch proxpn and you are not connected to a wireless network, it does not launch.  you must first connect to the wireless network, and only then launch proxpn.  if you have set up proxpn to launch at start up, it will work as long as your computer is set to automatically connect to a network, which will probably happen before proxpn is launched automatically.

the same thing happens to me in 10.8.  if you hold option before releasing command in the application switcher, the finder window (and not the window of the desktop) gets focus.  holding option makes the application switcher "reopen" the application, so that if for example the application has no default windows (like a file browser window in finder), a default window is reopened.  you could also consider using other methods than command-tab to focus finder, like assign a keyboard shortcut for focusing finder or use alfred. 
converting a vm to a bootcamp image is not supported and is technically difficult for a number of reasons, not least of which is that a windows installation for a vm (or any physical computer) will not necessarily have all the drivers needed to run on different hardware
there is software that can track this folder and augment the standard behavior that you are seeing.  i find default folder to be the best of class, and you can try it for free and then decide if it's worth paying once you've had a chance to kick the tires a bit.  http://www.stclairsoft.com/defaultfolderx/ 
as far as i know, every emacs under the sun can run in a terminal:  /applications/emacs.app/contents/macos/emacs -nw   change the path, of course, if your emacs resides elsewhere
if your mac has a trackpad, you can click with two fingers to bring up that menu without delay
with the \033]0;text\007 escape sequence.  example of use in bash echo -ne "\033]0;$pwd\007"  which you could add to your $prompt_command if you use bash, or otherwise attach to you ps1 so it gets re-evaluated often  example: `export prompt_command='echo -ne "\033]0;$pwd\007"' 
the shortest way: right-click the file icon in the title bar of the document window. it will display a drop-down menu of the file's location path
 enter mission control hover over the selected space or hold &#x2325; remove by clicking on the x    
you probably just missed a setting
i just got it to work — inserted a layout break after my headline and set it up as a one-column layout and the rest of the content as a two-column layout
if you don't see your network's ssid in the iphone's list of wi-fi networks, you can always try the other option in the wi-fi settings screen to manually input the ssid and security settings.    if that doesn't work, you'll probably want to turn on ssid broadcast and temporarily disable your mac filtering to troubleshoot the issue. 
go to itunes on a computer and select your account (on the right hand side of the window towards the top once you are signed in)
no, while the lg 40ub800t tv claims that it can run at up to 100hz as a tv
as far as i know, you can't unlock with apple after you've purchased an iphone.  in the us, the laws regarding cellphone unlocking haven't changed, but a library of congress exemption to the law has recently not ben renewed so you might only legally unlock if your carrier allows. 
check out boom, it's quite awesome.     boom boosts the volume of your mac at all levels
from a terminal window:     sudo defaults write /system/library/user\template/non_localized/library/preferences/com.apple.setupassistant didseecloudsetup -bool true   source 
i tried every of this solution
it's actually pretty simple to do in windows:   download the beta .dmg. open it in a file compression/extraction program (i used 7-zip). locate and extract the .ipsw file
the launch daemon of avatron airconnect is installed to /library/launchdaemons
as one can see you have the "remember networks this computer has joined" enabled.  when you join new network, that information is saved in the   com.apple.airport.preferences.plist   located in systemconfiguration folder.  obviously icloud gets that file.  edit  since you asked a new question and want to know how icloud does that read this
http://bugreport.apple.com is the canonical bug reporting mechanism
when you run that command, launchd will update the database every week automatically
in order to get this to work, in iterm preferences i had to set the key alt+backspace (or w/e you have it as) to map to these hex codes:  0x1b 0x08  
the basics: time machine  time machine is apple's backup solution, included in os x
create a folder in your user directory
as of aperture 3.3, iphoto and aperture can now open the same photo libraries, so no importing is necessary. 
in mountain lion you can use the caffeinate command.  caffeinate -u -t 1000   will prevent idle sleep for 1000 seconds. 
you will need to edit the refit configuration file
the solution was obvious once i saw it: first make quicksilver the foreground app, then it won't return focus to another app when the script runs.  tell application "quicksilver" to activate do shell script "pmset -c displaysleep 180" with administrator privileges  
under mail / preferences / accounts and selecting your account and then advanced, you'll find an option to keep copies of message for offline viewing
got a reply back from the author
if you can transfer the document to a general-purpose app that "knows" about files (like goodreader, air sharing, or ibooks), you should be able to access it from the file-handling dialog from within itunes
i figured it out
grandperspective can create a treemap:   
you can switch which monitor is the "primary" monitor by opening the displays in preferences and dragging and dropping the menu bar to your secondary monitor
in settings --> location services each application that uses location services is listed
yes!   orbit - cmd+ctrl and click/drag pan - cmd+ctrl+shift and click/drag zoom - two-finger scroll up/down (no click necessary)  
you can use control + shift + eject to put your display to sleep but also to lock your screen
yes - at the moment - those link speeds are the theoretical maximum speed at which data can transfer to or from those devices.  the efi firmware version on your macbook pro controls these link speeds as well as many other aspects of cpu throttling, so without reverse engineering that code - it's hard to know what or why the link may re-negotiate at a different speed
perhaps you have somehow turned on the zoom feature of accessibility?    open the settings app tap general tap accessibility turn off zoom   if you need more details, the following article might help  https://www.apple.com/ios/accessibility-tips/ 
yes - the new mobile iphoto app shows all sorts of photo metadata (assuming you allowed the camera app to store it in the first place) including the capture time.    camera roll and photo stream are part of the library, so you should be good to go
the save as pdf option in the print window is controlled by the system, not word
boot into windows and use the bootcanp control panel to set the next boot to be mac os x
the feature was lost in the initial release of pages 5, but was brought back in in iwork 5.2.  you can choose the shortcuts f1 through f8, and it appears to be a per-document setting
its a good idea to reformat the machine, because who knows what all was ran on it, and whether that may cause problems for you later or more so now
require administrator for airport  you can set up your computer to require an administrator password to change airport settings, including changing networks.   open system preferences → network.   select your wifi service in the services list.   click advanced… in the bottom-right corner.   select the options that you would like to require administrator authorization for.   click ok, then apply.  
the image is available at papers.co in both parallax and normal versions:   http://papers.co/ma28-frog-boy-leaf-flower-nature/    
i found the answer here
after flipping through "iwork:the missing manual" and digging a little deeper, i discovered that those watermark style background images were immobile because they were "locked." so i clicked "unlock" in the arrange menu, and then i could delete or manipulate those images. 
the folders or paths excluded from the time machine backup are stored in /library/preferences/com.apple.timemachine.plist  to include them again modify the file with an editor (texteditor will not work) or sudo nano /library/preferences/com.apple.timemachine.plist and remove all entries in the skippaths array
you can't do this with the normal three-finger tap, but if you make an automator service with some applescript, you can trigger it on a keyboard shortcut
ok i got it working with the awesome tweak assistant+
well, seems the answer is:     the only hack i found was to map ctrl-l to ctrl-] by add this to   .vimrc:  map &lt;c-l&gt; &lt;c-]&gt;   
ok, i think i've got it working.  add the file /library/launchdaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist with contents:  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt; &lt;!doctype plist public "-//apple//dtd plist 1.0//en"          "http://www.apple.com/dtds/propertylist-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;com.nullvision.noatime&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;programarguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;mount&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;-vuwo&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;noatime&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;runatload&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;   run these:   sudo chown root:wheel /library/launchdaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist sudo chmod 644 /library/launchdaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist sudo launchctl load -w /library/launchdaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist   the permissions have to be set to that for launchctl not to complain.  then you've got this on restart:  $ mount | grep " / " /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled, noatime)   you can check if it runs by looking in the console:  29/07/12 2:55:45.334 pm sudo[978]:     aram : tty=ttys000 ; pwd=/library/launchdaemons ; user=root ; command=/bin/launchctl load -w /library/launchdaemons/com.nullvision.noatime.plist  
i figured it out
yes you can
i had the same problem with cifs-mount, x-browser… that happened because i tried sharity 3 and 'deleted' it by putting the icon in the trash, like mac users usually do
thanks god
i suggest you use ecamm call recorder
delete your mail account and log out of facebook? 
you can't recover data directly - in the sense of recovering data lost by accidentally deleting files or formatting a volume - in internet recovery mode/recovery mode because no appropriate tools are available in the base os x system.  you may clone a disk or volume with dd to an external drive and check the data on a second mac using a recovery app like data rescue/disk warrior or lazesoft mac data though
sync your ipod touch configuration back to itunes and then sync your ipad with itunes!  for syncing your ipod configuratuon you must only connect it with itunes
i don't have an answer to your specific question--keeping the 200 (exactly) most recent photos on your phone, but i can give you a suggestion that may satisfy the spirit, if not the letter, of your request.  connect the iphone to your mac and load the photos into iphoto (or aperture if you prefer)
that means traceroute didn't get any responses to its probes
it depends on your project size, but an ssd is unlikely to make a huge difference in compilation speeds - it's almost entirely a cpu-bound task
create a new google account for each calendar
if adding to the front of a file is ok then i use drafts for this.  it allows you to type some text and have it added to the front ("prepended") of a file in dropbox
after select pinyin in your input language you can open any editor like textedit:    when you start typing you see the box (like below box) and can select your desire word.   
occassionally i use mouse locator when giving demos to help the audience track my mouse movements
i use issh: http://www.zinger-soft.com/issh_features.html it's available on the app store, but if you're jailbroken you can ssh to 127.0.0.1 and it works just fine
dockspaces is nice and convenient, but annoyingly unscriptable
either…   put the files in the mac partition: boot camp has drivers for read/write to hfs+ put the files in the windows partition: install software on os x  such as ntfs-3g  
uncheck airplay  goto the the airplay tab in airport utility and uncheck 'enable airplay'.  reboot all airplay playback devices  to ensure that you will be able to wake output airplay devices through the airport router reboot connected output airplay devices.  also, the connected airplay device might have to be connected through ethernet for it to be able to wake from sleep when video/audio is sent to it. 
as shown in the following image, you can remove login items by selecting them (highlighting them) and clicking the "-" button
if you have three podcasts as follows:   a - downloaded, synced and played b - downloaded, synced and not played c - newly downloaded, never synced, and not played   when choosing "all unplayed", podcasts b &amp; c will by synced
with mountain lion the bug seems to be fixed. now i have no problem assigning the hotkeys as desired. 
you can't generally password protect specific apps without some jailbreaking i assume, but you can restrict certain things, a few of which i recommend if you are giving it to a young one. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4213 describes the restrictions process, and it lists      you can choose to restrict access to the following applications and features on the device:      safari,   youtube,   itunes,   ping,   app installation,   app deletion,   camera,   facetime,   location,   account changes,   multiplayer games in game center,   adding friends in game center.      in addition, you can choose to prevent access to specific content types:   in-app purchases,   music and podcasts,   movies,   tv shows,   apps.   you can also set itunes restrictions for content via http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1904, but again, this isn't device specific at the time, it is when you are buying or downloading content from the internet. 
yes, you can get external iphone batteries.  amazon will have very many products. 
open the terminal, and execute  touch /applications/xcode.app   a zero-sized file named xcode.app will be created under that path
with mavericks and later, you can do this using applescript's 'display notification':  display notification "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" with title "title"                               that's it—literally that simple! no 3rd-party libraries or apps required and is completely portable for use on other systems
i've discovered the quicksilver displays plugin changes color depth for lion as well
i'd recommend installing xquartz, which is a very nice x server for os x. 
on the us keyboard it is in the top left corner to the left of the 1.  you'll see it just under the tilde sign (~) in the top left of the keyboard
the app store tells you how long something that you have just purchased will take to download.  once the purchase has been made, just switch to the purchases tab, and see the progress bar and the time estimate.  obviously for large files, the estimate is based on how much more data is left to download divided by the current download rate; so your estimated download time will vary as the transfer of the file progresses.  the same is true for downloads on the updates tab also.   
 pull down notification menu. tap "usb for charging / touch for more options" tap "transfer files (mtp)"  
i have discovered that 100% of the times that this happened to me, it was because i either had:   a usb (or firewire) peripheral connected that was pooling the bus and for some mysterious reason caused your behavior
for apps that are not sandboxed  example:   to regain warnings about permanent version storage for apple pages  quit the app, then a one-line command in terminal:   defaults write ~/library/preferences/com.apple.pages nsdocumentsuppresstempversionstorewarning -int 0   – in the preferences area that's familiar to users of snow leopard and less
i restored it from trash and removed again and icon disappeared 
• open the ibooks app.  • go to the ibooks store (left of the toolbar, at the top).  • on the right-hand-side, in the quick links list, click the purchased link.  • books will appear; find the one you want to remove and hover your mouse over the cover.  • a little 'x' will appear; click it to remove the book.  the book will no longer come up in ibooks (or any other locations), no matter whether you have set ibooks to show or hide icloud items. 
yes - i had to do this for the same devices: 2g to 4g
itunes starts playing what is currently selected

it can be enabled via system preferences > users &amp; groups > [unlock] > login options > show fast user switching menu as...   
make an automator app called "chromiumlauncher" that runs the commands you want
i wound up using the applescript   tell application "finder"     try         mount volume "smb://username:password@server/sharename"         delay 1     end try end tell   that i found at: how can i get automator...  saved as an application and then run via login items in the system prefs. 
hold the alt or option key and open imovie
i feel the same way you do about this
you can boot into recovery mode by following the instructions outlined in ht4718 and re-install os x from there:     os x lion or os x mountain lion includes a built in set of utilities in the recovery system
disktester from diglloydtools and its "recondition" seems like one of the only options. 
that is not possible using the default mail app
it's been confirmed elsewhere that metadata alone will not give success in matching (if it were, someone would quickly find a way to just create thousands of dummy files with the right metadata)
a) figure out how much space photostream is occupying on the device   go to settings general -> usage wait until the top is done and then click on photos and camera the next page under photo and camera has the space used for camera roll, photo library, and the photo stream.   b) reduce space.  after taking photos you can edit and crop, delete the ones that you do not want
its not a safari specific solutions, but slife works pretty well to do what you're saying
having documents &amp; data active doesn't mean that your documents get saved to icloud
you can press ⌘+⌥ to see filepath in quicklook pop-up. 
if you'd like to disable photo stream on your ios device, go to settings > icloud > photos and switch off "my photo stream".  as for the personal stream with photos being uploaded manually, you can, in fact achieve this.  i find that the easiest way to do this is to first go into your photo library and select the photos that you want to upload.    after that, select the "share" button (the one on the bottom left corner of the screen) and select "icloud".    you'll be greeted with the screenshot below
when an interface self-assigns an ip it generally means the interface isn't getting any response from your router or dhcp server

xcode actually has svn bundled in its .app directory
apple's solution, like it or not, is to use exposé or mission control (lion) to switch between windows
 (optional:) backup the content of the volume "backup"
i have not tried that specifically, but after trying out pretty-much every window-position-remembering app out there, i found that only stay actually did what i wanted.  it lets one save the window configuration for each display configuration, and seems to be spaces-aware.  i have nothing to do with them, but thought they provided something useful. 
as suggested by the op, from the comments:  depending on the pdf viewer, the pdfs could be stored in the cloud, using something like dropbox
yes, as is now disclosed in the location database kerfuffle, ios will cache wifi and cell tower location near it's location so that when internet access is temporarily unavailable, the device can still trilaterate based on what the wifi receiver is seeing for ssid.  so, i have had my non 3g ipad correctly locate itself driving down the highway 50 miles from where it last had a wifi connection
if by "3g chip", you are referring to the ipad microsim card, then no, you do not need to power off the device to switch it out
i had something similar happen to me once
no there is no way to accomplish this.  from apple - apple watch     you close the exercise ring when you reach the globally recommended 30 minutes of exercise per day
hdat2 5.0  version 5.3.0 of ultimate boot cd (ubcd) includes hdat2 5.0
you can disable icon preview in the view settings. for example: right click the desktop and select "show view option" and then uncheck the last box.   
there is apparently an option to adjust screen rotation in the control center on the ipad air 2, since it has no side switch
apple offers a feedback form where both bug reports and feature requests can be submitted by anyone
it is an unnecessary file
the only way to sync a non-apple device with icloud is to sync your mac with icloud, then sync you may with the device using isync. 
bad idea  using rm to move files to trash is like weed
here are some ways to check for issues but i fear they may not be a complete or even the correct solution without more peeking or poking:  in another shell after you start your python process (or if you screen / tmux it):   df / top -l 1 -s | head -12 vm_stat and vm_stat 600 sudo du -sm /var/vm/*   once you have a good baseline, you can watch things over time to see how the neural net is behaving each hour for a while
yes.  macs have built-in drivers that allow you to print to just about any usb printer.  and if the computer doesn't already have drivers (although, just about every consumer printer does), dell supplies drivers for mac. you may also need to install the custom drivers if you want more advanced functionality (e.g, some brands require you to install their drivers to enable networked print).  you can easily add printers using the the print &amp; scan pane of system preferences: just click the plus button.  
the ipod touch has a lithium-ion battery, which really does not need to be conditioned like the older battery technologies did.  in fact, completely discharging a lithium-ion battery too often can severely shorten its life, so i wouldn't recommend doing a full discharge too often
if the contacts in question are coming from icloud, you'll need to change the account in settings → icloud to a different icloud account.  your contacts may also be coming from a different account (or multiple accounts)
no
you wouldn't need two vms running, merely one running while you use the host os x would accomplish what you want
have you tried system pref > mission control > and uncheck "displays have separate spaces" 
i finally found a way around the problem although still not knowing what was causing it.  i guess that the last backup (2014-09-22) corrupted the data (for whatever reasons) and with the entries from the logs in mind i was not sure if this backup was really complete
they don't have to be the same
you have to use a usb to vga/hdmi adopter
i'll answer that it's not currently possible in hopes that someone can answer this and prove i'm wrong on this. 
 go into settings > music > and enable "show all music". the undeletable song have the cloud symbol next to them. redownload the songs. once finished downloading, go back to settings>music> and disable "show all music" then the swipe-to-delete will work again for the rogue songs
hopefully someone else can provide an easier answer or an app that automates this, but the method i've found so far only works for jailbroken phones:   use ifile or some other file manager to access .amr files that are stored in /var/mobile/library/voicemail
right-click or control+click on the documents folder in the finder, and click 'make alias'.  you probably want to move the alias somewhere else and rename it "documents"
i think you need this:      sudo scutil –-set hostname dserodio.local   the command that you are running is temporary.  source  http://osxdaily.com/2010/09/06/change-your-mac-hostname-via-terminal/

here are 5 mac utilities that alter the mouse acceleration curve, speeds, and/or add features to mice in os x:  usb overdrive  $20 (shareware; free unlimited, fully functional trial)     usb overdrive is a popular program   that works with just about any usb or   bluetooth input device
the boot camp assistant will move any file (if any) which may reside in your future windows partition to a appropriate position in your then shrinked mac partition before creating unallocated disk space in the repartitioning process. therefore there is absolutely no need to defrag in the forefront. please read do partitions on ssds map to physical addresses?  or with other words:  a ssd works like an amazon distribution hub:        and a hd like walmart:    if both of them want to sell a new product (let's say windows) amazon just has to find empty boxes to stack all the different windows
when you say that you disabled the firewall, do you mean the one in: system preferences &gt; security &gt; firewall, or the ipfwip firewall that you can access from the command line? or perhaps both?  to check to see if you have ipfw rules, you can always go to the terminal and type in:  sudo ipfw list  you might also use nmap to check if the port is open from different places on your internal network
the answer to this question is incredibly simple, and needs no elaboration other than enough to justify the size of the post and prevent stack exchange from automatically marking it as low quality or affecting it
only the macbook air (mid 2011 or newer), macbook pro with retina display were originally supported supported for power nap

i think you have "adware" infection: download adwaremedic (now called malwarebytes) from  http://www.adwaremedic.com/index.php then run the scan. 
i guess the answer's 'no', then
select the folder you want (or command + a to select all) and then press:   command + right arrow   and the left arrow undoes what the right arrow did, should you want to close things back up again. 
since the two mac are in the same house, i assume they're both on the same network.  first of all, you need to activate remote login on the mac where you want the sound out.  go to system preferences &gt; sharing and check the remote login checkbox. then, using your computer, open terminal and type this  ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;computer name.local&gt;   where &lt;user&gt; is your wife login and &lt;computer name&gt; is the name of the other computer.  now, it's as if you're having terminal open on your wife's computer and you can say whatever you like. 
if you are going to jailbreak your iphone, i can strongly suggest bitesms
i would create a smart mailbox containing all flagged items, and then (this is the one you want) a smart mailbox with the 'not in mailbox' option to return all the items that are not flagged, and thus not in that mailbox
despite joost's links, apple did officially provide a size limit for messages attachments.  extracted from mountain lion's features page:     send large attachments: send high-quality photos, full hd video, or documents
console.log is usually written to by calls to apple's nslog() function call
i use daisy disk to keep tabs on what's using up space on my disks

this is not possible, the multi monitor support on lion is ridiculously lacking, especially given apple jumping up and down about how amazing thunderbolts (and the displays) are.  if you want to use more than one screen, you are pretty much unable to use fullscreen
use a smart playlist
i think you are going about this the wrong way
there's no default, but you could probably use applescript to accomplish this
you can't mount a http/https server as a filesystem since it won't provide a directory table for you
problem solved! let's say that i was not that familiar with apps that were running but had no open windows
there isn't a setting to change, so you might instead script the diskutil command to do the erase using applescript or another scripting language.  diskutil erasevolume disk12345   the erasevolume command just wipes the volume and recreates an empty filesystem to match what was there
as far as i'm aware apple doesn't offer the links directly, but iclarified has a complete list of ios downloads for all models of iphone available here
there is a bug in 10.8.2 where occasionally revealing files in finder stops working and archive utilility stops responding whenever you try to extract an archive.  as a workaround, you can terminate appleeventsd from activity monitor or with sudo killall -kill appleeventsd
when i posted, i suspected that this was specifically related to the yosemite update, as i'd seen a few hits in google with similar things (but no fixes), especially since i had already restored the meta-backup meant to address exactly the issue discussed in the older q's of generic network disk corruption

well, two trips to the genius bar couldn't solve it ("you need to start a new library from scratch and retag your 15,000 photos" - what?!?!), but i dug around and experimented and finally came up with the answer:  itunes won't sync pictures without up-to-date previews; so, if they stop auto-generating for some reason, you have to force it to update previews for the pictures that aren't syncing.   you may want to go to itunes and select "sync all photos" and note the number of photos that appears in the upper right of the window, so you can make sure that it's higher after this process. go to aperture and select "photos" up near the top of your library, in order to select your whole library of pics. in the "photos" menu up top, you should see "update previews for library"
i have found a way through bettertouchtool to do the following :   activate keyboard viewer by a shortcut close keyboard viewer by another shortcut toggle keyboard viewer by one shortcut (no need for the previous two) i also uploaded the applescript for convenience   platform : rmbp mountain lion osx 10.8    activate keyboard viewer by a shortcut   launch bettertouchtool  add keyboard shortcut add predefined action >> open application/file/script... navigate to macintosh hd/system/library/input methods/ select keyboardviewer   now you have a keyboard shortcut to activate the viewer without an additional script.  however, i noticed that pressing the red x button does not actually quit the application, which means that the keyboard viewer will only be activated once

notification center limits the size of a notification to 256 bytes (see developer reference), so there is no way to expand or change how much of a notification you see (unless you can find some third-party application that disables the limit).  after 256 bytes, the notification will be truncated and the user has to click on the notification to see the rest.  for example, if mail.app sends you a notification of a new message, you likely won't be able to read the whole message from the notification, so you'll have to click on it to open the message in mail.  however, if the notification is purely informative and does not point to a specific piece of data within the application, when you click on the notification, it will only open the application or, if it is already running, bring it to the foreground.  terminal is not a ui-based application, so notifications from it are not going to focus on a specific element

i have a fairly generic (mathematical) answer, but can only find some of the actual numbers.  after finding the 2010 mac mini environmental report from apple, there are four important numbers:   tbooting = the time taken to boot up and shut down (s) pbooting = the power consumption while booting or shutting down (w) psleep = the power consumption while sleeping (w) poff = the power consumption while off (w)   the last is actually stated in the mac mini's environmental report, and for very low sleep power usage can't just be ignored!  the total energy used during a period of sleep is:  esleep = time * psleep   the total energy used from shutting down, being off for a time and booting up is:  eshutdown = (time * poff) + (tbooting * pbooting)   requiring that eshutdown &lt; esleep, we can rearrange the inequality to give:  time &gt; tbooting * ( pbooting / (psleep - poff) )   the mac mini's environmental report provides psleep and poff, and if we assume say 90 seconds total booting/shutting-down time and about 35w during said times, this would give an answer of 45 minutes.  i've yet to find similar values for the laptops (they make a big deal about the mac mini being so energy efficient), and the booting power/times would really need to be measured to provide accurate figures

edit: as of version 10.5, bbedit has retina support.  i believe it's because bbedit, like some other applications (chrome, to name one) doesn't use the standard os x text rendering library, thus it doesn't automatically get the retina-calibre text, rather the text gets scaled up (like non-retina images), resulting in the blurry look.  luckily the bbedit team is working on it, they've released a beta version with retina support. 
several things come to mind:   did you wait overnight for it to run?  launchctl load won't make it run out of sequence -- if you want to make it run at some time other than 3:15 am, use sudo launchctl start dk.revealit.nightlyrsyncbackup after it's loaded. does the run-rsync script fire off any background processes, or does it do everything inline?  'cause if the script exits and there are background processes still going, launchd thinks something has gone wrong and kills the background processes

you can set up multiple different icloud accounts in the "mail, contacts, and calendars" preference panel, and also on your iphone and ipads.  i have accomplished a shared address book with my partner by each of us having a primary icloud account (me@us.com, her@us.com) - and then a shared icould account us@us.com.  one annoying downside is that the lion address book app labels both address books as "icloud" making it a bit hard to distinguish what contacts are where

if we are speaking only about screen sharing (ss) (forgetting ard), it is working as follows:  first, there is a daemon configuration file (/system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist)
it's fine, just realize the built in apache server will share the files you have placed there unless you change the apple supplied httpd.conf should you start up web sharing
i think not, only by using a hardware keyboard or via copy/paste from another doc or an app like unicode maps

the ios7 update enabled swipe to capture – allowing you to switch between camera modes like photo, video, square and panorama with a swipe.  the iphone 5, iphone 4, iphone 4s, ipad 4, ipad 3, ipad mini, and 5th-gen ipod touch have this feature, while only the ipad 2 does not. 
you could do worse than to try dupeguru, available from hardcoded software, i've had very good results with it
those are for the phones antennae (theres one towards the bottom of the phone as well).  the anodised aluminium causes really bad signal attenuation, hence the plastic-like strips are necessary to create a break in the metal shell.  i decided to delve a bit further and found that apple is trying to get rid of them. 
i looked around for something like teracopy a while back but everything i found was pretty horrid

rerunning the installer works for os x 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 - running the recovery disk assistant isn't a good idea if you are running 10.8 or newer os as well as hardware that ships with newer builds of os.  the lion recovery disk assistant can make a backup copy of the recovery partition.  the lion recovery disk assistant lets you create lion recovery on an external drive that has the same capabilities and limitations as the built-in lion recovery
applenapps  this is a list of games which take full advantage of airplay mirroring by offering special full screen 720p hd modes to show off the power of the a5 ship.  there are other apps that work with airplay mirroring which are not in this list, but they’re either poor apps overall, or it’s not a smooth translation.

windows 8 needs boot camp 5.1  your macbook can only run boot camp from dvd, not from usb [same for any superdrive-euipped macbook] &amp; also can, as far as i can tell, only run boot camp 4. that means your only choices are windows xp or vista, 32-bit.  see boot camp: system requirements for microsoft windows operating systems 
aside of using the target disk mode, which is sort of rough way, you can use the build in migration assistant already located in your utility folder.  it is designed to transfer information from- to but also to place it in the right position, unlike the target disk mode. 
there are 2 types of locking mechanism (certainly in ios 5 and ios 4.2.1).  firstly, in settings > general there is auto-lock, with settings of 1-5 minutes, or never.  secondly, same place, there is passcode lock, which if set has options of immediately, after 1, 5, 15 minutes, or 1, 4 hours.  the first of these locks your screen after a period of inactivity (for the purposes of saving battery hence the max of 5 minutes), but the second refers to the amount of time that must pass after the screen it locked before the passcode is required to unlock (for the purpose of security).  a common mistake it to confuse the two, and the wonder why it does (or doesn't) ask for your passcode each time

vlc was available on the itunes app store for some time, and the process for installing it was like any other.  however, a developer, who has contributed to vlc development in the past (iirc) got in contact with apple and asked vlc to be removed due to license incompatibility.  vlc is licensed gplv2, which states among many other things, that the source must be available, and i believe there are other provisions surrounding vlc with regard to apple's per-device drm.  thus, apple de-listed vlc from the app store, and you cannot buy it anymore

this is possible in pages '09, so it probably works in pages '08 as well.   select a heading in your document open the inspector (in menu bar click view -> show inspector)   select the text section select the "more" tab under "borders &amp; rules", click the dropdown that says "none" and select the line you want to use below the dropdown select the icon depicting the line above the content   open the styles drawer (in menu bar click view -> show styles drawer)   since the text is still selected, the heading you're using should already be highlighted click the arrow beside the style click "redefine style from selection"     now everywhere that you used that heading will now have a horizontal line over it, and it will automatically appear whenever you insert new headings
that's actually pretty easy, you just double click the icon in the menubar.   
i had a white macbook with roughly the same specifics (except for a 160 gb hd) and it wouldn't run so slowly.  you can try the following software fixes:   go to system preferences -> users and disable unnecessary login items

since the mouse pointer gets frozen, you can be pretty confident that the lockup is happening deep down in the system - kernel extensions, hardware interrupt type things.  assuming you have a great backup and don't mind futzing a bit (and i'll also assume you haven't extra cables, monitors, macs to just eliminate one thing at a time) you can surely try booting again in safe mode

yes its possible
@daniel's answer lead me to a working solution, so i'll post it up  using windows means that the apple script solution wasn't going to work, and so using the itunes.application com object my solution looks something like this (in ruby, cause i like ruby, though other scripting languages will work too).  require 'win32ole'  def main()     itunes = win32ole.new('itunes.application')     allpods = getallpodcasts(itunes);     allpods.tracks.each do |track|         track.playeddate = track.releasedate     end end   def getallpodcasts(itunes)     itunes.librarysource.playlists.each do |playlist|         return playlist if playlist.name == "all podcasts";     end     die "'all podcasts' not found" end  main()    i create a playlist called 'all podcasts' and make it just that. i have to use played date as my proxy for release date, as that is the only editable date field on a track in the com object version of itunes.   interestingly itunes does not equate "has a played date" with "has a played count > 0" so i can now have a playlist of podcasts that are unplayed, that meet whatever criteria i was using before, and that are selected by release date.  yay!

the apple mini-displayport to vga or hdmi adapter terminates the thunderbolt chain where it is connected, so until apple released new macbook pro with two thunderbolt ports (similar to the imac that has two ports) then you will only get one video signal from the device through the thunderbolt port.  you may find an inexpensive usb to vga solution to get around this limitation

the mechanism to force a full backup isn't well documented, but it does get logged to the console logs as forcing deep traversal on source: "macintosh hd" ... but even if this happens, the system will base the storage of new copies of files on what exists on the backup volume previously.  i would add a new drive and back up to it once if you are concerned that your backup is no longer reliable.  from the command line, you can then check on things with tmutil compare or by using a tool such as backuploupe to convince yourself that specific (or ongoing) backups are correctly being made. 
with snow leopard, you cannot sync docs, you can work around to sync calendars and contacts.  i would stick with mobileme as you have the idisk.  ios5 and icloud does sync docs accross devioces every time you make an edit

indeed, this appears to no longer be possible without 3rd-party software.  adding the same preference key to the new app seemed to not make any difference - it appears that this ability has been removed from the app.  as you mentioned, keyremap4macbook would work with the private.xml that you linked to.

something is wrong here!  it is correct there are always software updates, but it is not possible that your airport (wifi) does not work at all (unless it is broken) and no software will fix that, so you need to send your computer back.  make sure it is turned on in your system preference - network- wifi on!  now to the software updates:  even if you bought it tomorrow does not means it has the latest software updates.  since you do not have a wifi internet connection you can not get the software updates via internet.  you could bring it back to apple and they will fix it.  alternatively, get a piece of ethernet cable and connect to the router.  since it is a mba that does not has a ethernet plug, you will need a thunderbolt to ethernet plug.  then click on the apple (top left) and on the software update.

you can recreate the lion recovery partition by following the instructions available at this apple support document: http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1433  note, you are not supposed to be able to see the recovery partition in normal use, so can you clarify how you have identified it is missing?  what happend when you boot with the cmd-r keys held down? 
to be able to view invisible files…  open applescript editor, in applications > utilities then copy/paste this to a new script...  set newhiddenvisiblesstate to "yes" try     set oldhiddenvisiblesstate to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles"     if oldhiddenvisiblesstate is in {"1", "yes"} then         set newhiddenvisiblesstate to "no"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles " &amp; newhiddenvisiblesstate   tell application "finder"     set thewindows to every finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in thewindows         set this_item to item i of thewindows         set theview to current view of this_item         if theview is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theview     end repeat end tell   then save as an application, which you can then just double-click to toggle showing/hiding invisible files.  you don't need to kill the finder for this toggle, a refresh is sufficient - &amp; may be faster. 
in zsh you need to enable the completion system
2 ways i can think of, neither particularly 'fun'   the 'one rule' method     disable all rules bar one   put the 'mistreated' email back in the inbox   run the single rule   see if it moves the email   rinse &amp; repeat  the 'sounds' method     add a new line to each existing rule - play sound   repeat for each rule, using a different sound   move the email back to the inbox &amp; apply rules  a late posible 3rd… eliminate by halves [based on 1, but better for a large number of rules] but this requires that no rule will halt the entire process with "stop evaluating rules"

if they are stored locally instead of on icloud they will not sync. if you can place them in icloud they will sync correctly.  uncheck all accounts to find the wrongly placed contacts, happy hunting! (: 
the @ is the at sign for siri according to this unofficial guide:  http://www.siriuserguide.com/siri-dictation-guide/  i don't see any official apple resource but this wikipedia article documenting the basic latin unicode block (which also maps directly to ascii text) has english pronunciation that works well with siri.  the things i can't get to work from that table are:   ^ - circumflex _ - low line - (but underline works)   also, dictating quotes needs to be with the quote on/quote off command and not by dictating when the quotes should be typed. 
thanks for all your answers, especially allan. anyway, i will stick with the simplest and more reliable solution: use an ap-client featured access point attached to the ethernet switch, so i can connect to the internet through the lan, without using wi-fi.   
finally found an answer to this, thanks to galley from ilounge!   create a standard playlist called "not missing". drag your entire library into that playlist
agree with loïc that this question should be rephrased, but if you're looking for a possible solution without being subject to apple's whims, there are many third-party bluetooth keypads available...   lmp bluetooth keypad -- meant to attach to an apple wireless keyboard, but has mixed reviews microsoft bluetooth keypad -- blasphemy, i know, but it has good reviews logitech wireless keypad -- non-bluetooth alternative that uses logitech's mini usb receiver  
go to https://www.apple.com/support/ then search for dl1572  see apple knowledgebase pages often blank   edit - or in this case, not… as it doesn't seem to fix it  update: original kb link appears to be working again. would appear to have been an apple issue, now resolved.

disable atomic saves in advanced preferences.  when atomic saves are enabled, textmate actually writes to a new file on save and then moves the file over (hence overwriting your symbolic link).  see http://manual.macromates.com/en/saving_files#atomic_saves for more info. 
where is the itunes library directory? what is its filesystem location?  go to itunes > preferences...
one idea would be to run tagscanner, then create a new itunes library:    hold option while starting itunes. click "create new" library
there is no product that provides a stand and charger with a mic, but there are several external mics you can clip onto the iphone
your photos are probably gone from your phone, but there are a couple other places to check.  were you backing up to icloud? if so, you may be able to restore a backup from icloud to your phone and with it your camera roll

no easy way no
if you don't want to load some items that usually start on bootup or login, you can startup your machine in safe mode
phones that are off turn on when you plug them in
go to an apple store (or ask a friend with tech skills) to remove the hard drive from the macbook
the predominant theory as to why the current facebook app for ios is so sluggish is that the app:   suffers from its heavy use of javascript in a uiwebview component which does not currently benefit from the "nitro" javascript engine which is available to mobile safari is poorly designed   the app uses very little native code, and thus most of your interaction takes place within a uiwebview displaying html and executing javascript.  essentially, anywhere where an app is displaying something that looks and acts like it's "embedding a web browser", that's a uiwebview.  in very simple terms, the nitro javascript engine makes javascript "faster".  ios 4.3 brought the nitro engine to mobile safari, and ios 5 brought the nitro engine to web shortcuts launched from the home screen
you can also set a shortcut of your choosing by adjusting lion's built-in keyboard preferences
cmd-click to select the images you want to group and then opt-cmd-g to group them (find the group function under the arrange menu), then the images will move as one unit

you need to make changes to the router that makes your internet connection.  basically, there are 3 steps you need to complete:   create your website - you have done this enable sharing on the machine hosting it   at this point you have done all you can on your mac  get your external ip address, and configure your router to pass through port 80 (or whatever other port number you may use if you are not using the default) requests that come in from the internet to be passed directly to your machine.   this can be achieved in a myriad of ways, depending on your choice, your skill level, and how security conscious you are
that's about as much as needs to be done (and indeed can be done) other than removing and destroying your old drive for security purposes.  having said that, without specialist forensic equipment the chances of recovering data from a drive that's had a single zero-fill erase is essentially zero, and is pretty much beyond the scope of consumer-level data recovery software
yes, simply run the following in terminal:  sudo &lt;xcode&gt;/library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all   where &lt;xcode&gt; is the default installation of xcode, typically:  sudo /developer/library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all

the answer turns out to be surprisingly simple and, yet, hard to ascertain beforehand.  initially, i thought i would have to reserve space for the boot and rescue partitions, and then use the one partition layout in the disk utility to clone my existing hard drive.  my question was specifically about the partitioning, and not the physical aspect, or backups
yes, simply coping your entirely itunes folder to an other computer will do the trick
don't use fullscreen
the built-in way is to use the split command in the terminal, which, yes, is unix-y

you can read the recent items plist file.      defaults read $home/library/preferences/com.apple.recentitems   there's a lot of "noise" in the output
no, sorry
just to add to the first answer, yes you can use it as a shared drive (i do) it will also work with pc's not just macs, so for example if someone came round your house with a dell laptop you could give them access to it
there are tons of command line utilities to do this..
i am still looking for a solid answer
yes! when you open the app store's updates tab, you'll see a special dialog allowing you to accept the apps such as iphoto that were bundled with your computer

try pingmenu: https://github.com/kalleboo/pingmenu   
you can try installing a third party application called tinkertool.  tinkertool is an application that gives you access to additional preference settings apple has built into os x
yes - although most people are using the ios based keynote remote these days, the old infrared (which is very thin / physically touchable and very reliable in dark rooms and easily hidden in a hand) works just fine.  the keynote '09 help shows what functions the various buttons will perform when you are in the various modes: keynote window itself, presentation mode and slide switcher mode.

rsync is a good way to go (scp is pretty much the same with fewer features)
you can check a file by issuing the following command in terminal:   codesign -dv /applications/whatever.app   there is a free tool that implements the functions of the codesign command and extends it with a nice gui
there's a free app in the mac app store, miro video converter
i'm afraid not, which is a shame.  i think your best bet would be to use a program like textexpander ($35, trial available).  you can use that to define 'variables' (called 'snippets' by te, which means something entirely different in indesign...) like this: you type c1 and it automatically changes to name of client 1 (you'd fill in the actual name).  you can also automatically fetch things like date last modified by setting up a 'snippet' that runs a shell script or applescript. such a snippet could work like this: you type doc1mod and it would run a script you write (i can help you with that part if you want) that will find the date last modified for a document and replace doc1mod with that date.  this isn't as powerful or convenient as indesign text variables, but the end result should come close
 go into the settings app. enter the general pane and select date &amp; time. set your time zone.  
you can add up to 6gb of ram in your macbook
from one of the apple discussion forums, one user found a tool that could handle batch conversions of claris works documents:     panergy software had just the right tool for me
method #1  the easiest way would be to access your network router's administration page
you can change the system preferences for joinmode and joinmodefallback to be the following:      joinmode (string)         automatic         preferred         ranked         recent         strongest     joinmodefallback (string)         prompt         joinopen         keeplooking         donothing   do this using the airport command:   /system/library/privateframeworks/apple80211.framework/versions/a/resources/airport   run the command to see the options, up the top you'll see a section on how to sec preferences.  for instance:  sudo /system/library/privateframeworks/apple80211.framework/versions/a/resources/airport prefs joinmode=strongest  
seems that you have problems connecting to github via https.  while i'm not sure what could cause it and how to fix it, you still can use git with another protocol.  here's the commands to install homebrew in /usr/local/ from scratch using git:// instead of https://:  cd /usr/local/ git init -q git remote add origin git://github.com/mxcl/homebrew git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master -n git reset --hard origin/master   that should work
well you can use any digital audio editor to combine songs
well, at the moment, there isn't much to see with that option
i always use this combo as well, however this does not immediately sleep my machine in ml.  i believe this is a separate issue at play here
there are web-based ides that support java like ide one and codebox that should work from an ipad
you can do this with the if function
there is no easy way to disable / delete the apple id from apple's servers, but you can delete all the personal data (contacts, calendars, mail) and then change the contact information and security questions / password to ones that you will no longer use or ever enter into a device

it depends
finder will prevent you from deleting the default directories, but terminal won't
i use a third party preference pane compost that deletes from trash when the disk fills up or if the file has been in trash for a given time
since i don´t assume anyone to ever build a mini displayport to minidisplayport+audio adapter, and the option of going mini-dp&lt;>dual dvi&lt;>mini-dp seems to be quite expensive and bulky, why don´t you simply use the optical audio from your macbook pro´s audio output? 
unlikely.  such functionality is indirectly excluded by the ios developer program licence agreement under section 3.3.4.  there it is stated that applications may only write data to an application's designated container area on the device
apple documents the open source components for each release at the web page:   http://www.opensource.apple.com   internally, they clearly do work before it's publicly documented as we have 10.9.2 out today but only 10.9 is listed publicly with the versions. 
you can drag tabs between windows in safari (i beleive this was added in safari 4 along with a few other improvements) 
apparently it has been removed according to a discussion on apple's forums 
yes, technically, you can, but you shouldn't.  reasons you shouldn't:   apple will sometimes update the applications in minor os upgrades
so had a call with apple customer care as i want to get to the root cause and they have finally resolved this issue
your computers should be accessible as computer-name.local, e.g
i am surprised the suggestions have not piled up in the hour since you posted... 1-best answer: put an ssd on the mini, it will feel way better than even maxing out ram (i assume you already have a decent amount of ram to start with, i.e., not less than 8gb and are running mavericks) if you've already done all of the above then anything else you might do will probably give you less of a performance jump. 
apple software volume licensing lets you purchase bundles of 20+ licenses for apple software, including lion
you haven't missed anything obvious other than that finder is the primary (and nearly exclusive) mechanism for placing and reading file tags on mavericks.  there is no interface for calendars, contacts, mail (or ilife) to use the filesystem tags directly as far as i can tell.  the only apps i've seen that have an interface to tags other than finder are the new iwork apps where they are document based apps and you can assign tags in the two places:   the save dialog from the document icon in the window's header bar    
oops, just tried it again
activate  use the applescript command activate to bring the terminal.app application to the front:  tell application "terminal"     activate end tell   using osascript this becomes:  osascript -e 'tell application "terminal" to activate'  
diskwarrior 4. it will run you $99
autofocus on the iphone is done via an electrical motor, moving the front lens backward and forward, and software that captures and analyses the image for best sharpness, which usually is the "sweet" spot
 tap settings and then tap the icloud icon. tap "storage &amp; backup." tap manage storage. tap your ios device in the backups area. under backup options, turn off any items that you no longer wish to back up. return to storage &amp; backup and tap “back up now.” this will immediately remove the requested backup data from icloud. choose “delete backup” if you want to turn off backup and remove all data for that backup from icloud.

your wish is my command!  homebrew formula: sc.rb  i'll try to get the formula merged into homebrew proper sometime this week.  in the meantime, you can simply:  brew install https://gist.github.com/geoff-codes/d8c16ada1de10e6387b3/raw/sc.rb 
the exif data is corrupted.  to attempt to obtain the exif data for the bad images, try this get-exif-info webapp.  the issue is whitespace at the end of the xmp section of the image files, which when parsed with any standard xml tool will throw a 'content not allowed in trailing section' error.  i finally got around to writing a little utility that fixes this specific issue by trimming the xmp xml within the image and then writing the xmp block back to the image preserving all the data.  i've uploaded the source of my jpeg xmp xml trimmer to google code so anyone can make use of it to fix this issue if they'd like
so the short answer with reply is, "sure, but why?!?"  the webserver for mac os x (i'm assuming 10.6 snow leopard client for the details of the answer) is based entirely on apache
create the arrow     from the insert shape menu choose the "draw with pen" tool:    click once at one end of your curved arrow:  click and drag at the other end of your arrow:  hit the escape key to stop drawing. from the line ends menu, choose an arrowhead you like:        edit the arrow    to reshape the curve, click on it once, then click on it again; when the endpoints turn red you can change things:   click and drag the round circles at the end of the gray bezier handles to reshape the curve (a little practice makes perfect):   click and drag one of the red endpoints to change the start or end:

just go up to the menu bar and hit update>ignore update (or the keyboard shortcut is apparently just the delete key). 
when i connect my iphone to a windows machine, it does appear as a digital camera and allows me to copy files from the dcim folder or to use the "import pictures" option from windows.  i just tried this in a windows 7 vm and was able to view all the pictures in my camera roll. from there, i could drag and drop pictures to my desktop.  i don't have itunes installed in the windows 7 vm.  it works the same way in my windows xp machine, at work
though quicktime does not (and i couldn't find a codec plugin to support it), vlc apparently plays avchd video files (.mts)
you can do this -- just configure the ubuntu virtual machine with a static ip
the simplest way is for you to note the date and time of your last backup in time machine on os x mountain lion. you can get back to it at any point in time in the future just by restoring to the backup with that date/time (this will remain on the disk as long as you have adequate space so that time machine does not delete these older versions).   you can easily find this date and time by navigating into the "backups.backupdb" folder on the time machine disk and looking at the timestamp for the "latest" folder (it is actually a link - so you can even open it to see the latest backup folder name with the date and time).     if you do not wish to note down the date and time of your last backup with os x mountain lion, the next simplest way is to change the computer name either on the mac on os x mavericks before you do your first time machine backup on it or on the time machine backup disk for the older backup.  in either case, this will make time machine create a new folder with the new machine name on the disk and it will do a full backup the first time (so you need adequate disk space to hold almost two copies of your mac)
to follow up martin's answer, for british english you will need to edit the list and check the "british english" tick box
my solution to mapping keyboard shortcuts to arbitrary services (as well as general workflows, application launches and scripts) is fastscripts.  try it for free and pay if you feel you can or need more than 10 shortcuts to be active at the same time.

you are actually correct as the highlighting appears for words that the system doesn't think that it fully recognized
not sure if this is really a good idea, but you can run this (as yourself, not root) in terminal:  launchctl unload -w /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.addressbook.sourcesync.plist   fwiw, i had the same problem and even after following the instructions in tetsujin's link, turning off all contacts accounts in system preferences, logging out of icloud, blowing away the addressbooksourcesync directories in ~/library/caches and ~/library/application support, and of course many reboots, i could not get addressbooksourcesync to stop blocking sleep
here are the steps to save multiple images in preview into a single multi-page pdf.   select all of the images you want in your pdf, right-click and choose open with preview in preview's sidebar drag the images into the order you want them to appear in your pdf select/highlight all the images to be included in the pdf document; otherwise only a single image may end up the pdf document then from the "file" menu choose "print selected images" (or "print..." in recent os x versions) and then "pdf > save as pdf"  
address book has this functionality built in
it turns out the issue for me is that osx has created 2 entries in the calendar app for my gmail account (even though i only have the account entered once under the internet accounts system pref).  the calendar app won't let me delete the duplicate since it thinks the duplicate is managed under the internet accounts pref
after reviewing the preferences as well as defaults, there does not appear to be a way to disable the confirmation message. 
i use btt (better touch tool) which includes window snapping, as well as a whole host of other useful features such as extra multitouch gestures, and button management.  you can use as much or as little as you want, but window snapping is on by default and just means you drag an application to the top to maximise it, left to align and fill the left half, and to the right for the right.  edit: this is called bst (better snap tool) and it is no longer free. el capitan has an implemented feature (press green button until you can drop it to the side) or check other free tools like spectacle  update: as of feb 20, 2016 bst is $2.99 usd. 
it looks like you can if using windows.  is os x the backups seems to be stored in the following location ...  ~/library/application support/mobilesync/backup   ..
as far as i know, it's not possible to do so dynamically
directly no.  you can go the indirect route
try this:  ping -c 1 google.com | grep "time=" | sed -e "s/(.*)time=([.0-9]+) ms/\2/"   if you want to get an minimal value for some number of requests use:  ping -q -c 5 google.com | tail -1 | cut -d "=" -f 2 | cut -d "/" -f 1   replace 1 in -f 1 with:   2 for average 3 for maximum  
i have the low-end mbp 15'' early 2011.  it has a sata3 interface
system integrity protection in 10.11 can be disabled, though it's not something you should do lightly.  you can disable sip entirely by doing the following:   reboot your mac hold ⌘r during reboot from the utilities menu, run terminal enter the following command     csrutil disable   alternatively you can re-enable sip while still allowing dtrace to work by also running the following:  csrutil enable --without dtrace   note, that when doing so you'll get the following warning:     this is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.   once you reboot, dtrace will work as it did in yosemite. 
you can use this application. it uses an hidden file stored on the iphone recording an history of location
as far as i know, the only way to do this is to jailbreak and use a cydia app called anylockapp. it allows you to configure the behavior of the camera button that appears on the lock screen
rather than give geoff sudo privileges, consider adding the account to the admin group so that it inherits the admin group sudoer privileges

there are really only two ways to back up your ipad
there's really nothing to worry about - what you're seeing are icmp redirects, and they are not a problem as such.  the reasoning behind what you're seeing is this:  your mbp usually has the mac address of wwwelc in its arp cache
a few ways to approach....   clone your existing drive to a drive image on the 1tb (if it has room)
it's poorly documented, but it is indeed possible with the screencapture command.  screencapture ~/desktop/screen1.png ~/desktop/screen2.png [...]   here's the relevant section from man screencapture:   files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen   of course, if you're calling it programmatically, you might not know how many monitors there are, so you'll have to parse the output of system_profiler spdisplaysdatatype or defaults read /library/preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist to determine how many filename arguments to pass to screencapture
i'm not sure it's set in stone anywhere, but the convention for ask different seems to be along the lines of  &lt;kbd&gt; cmd ⌘ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; ctrl ⌃ &lt;/kbd&gt;  &lt;kbd&gt; opt ⌥ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; shift ⇧ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; t &lt;/kbd&gt;  cmd ⌘   ctrl ⌃    opt ⌥   shift ⇧   t    giving the abbreviated name &amp; key symbol, no + between  it's not as tidy as the apple way, admittedly.  i'm not certain for 'key equivalents' but maybe  opt ⌥   shift ⇧   \  = » as your option 2.  btw, i use system prefs > keyboard > text to generate these quickly in stack exchange (which apparently only works in safari, not firefox or chrome, see replace text with predefined value in browser)   
make the contents of your ~/library/keybindings/defaultkeybinding.dict look like the text below    /* my keybindings */  { "@\u007f" = "deletewordbackward:"; /* delete backwards one word */ }      '@' represents the command key   '\u007f' represents the delete key 'deletewordbackward' is a keyword which cocoa applications understand   once you restart any cocoa app, this will now just delete one word to the left of the cursor instead of everything between the beginning of the line and the cursor. 
sudo passwd root   enter your password and you're in. 
yes you can — icloud can be used to sync anything that you wish.   open ~/library/mobile documents and create a folder (call it anything you wish). inside, put whatever documents you would like to sync over icloud. that folder will sync with other macs (and jailbroken ios devices, and on the web too if you have a apple developer licence).   alternatively, you can symlink a folder on your mac in to the mobile documents folder so that the files remain in their original location. 
assuming your launchd job is correctly set-up, you may be reaching a limitation of applescript.  applescript requires a gui (aqua session)  if your applescript is launched using launchd as a user root process, it will not have a graphical user interface associated

so, using a little plist trickery, i've managed to re-assign those keys.  the steps i took are the following:   aperture > commands.
while textmate doesn't have built-in ftp or ssh capabilities there are a few bundles for it that have tried to remedy this shortcoming.  in particular the ftp/ssh bundle aims to provide what you seek: a way to define a "project" that can be synchronized (both up and down) with a remote file system
if you have terminal.app open anyway (doesn't matter whether it's in fullscreen mode or not):   cmd-t to create new tab/shell ps aux | fgrep /dev/random to find the running cat (you can grep for cat as well but there might be more than one matching line) kill &lt;pid from above&gt; (or kill -9 &lt;pid&gt;)   just be patient, the system may be really slow (even on a multicore system as i've just found out). 
no - time machine has set permissions on the drive and has full root access to delete any and all backups that the algorithm feels needs to be deleted.  you get warned after the deletion happens, so you will need to copy that snapshot to another drive or outside the backups.backupdb folder on that drive to ensure time machine won't delete it if you leave it mounted and space fills up on the drive to the point where the estimated size of the next backup exceeds the free space on the volume. 
the most important upgrade is making the system drive a solid state drive (ssd)
i've noticed the same thing, but only when there was a notification on the lock screen
abc extended behavior has not changed from that of us extended, you type circumflex via option 6 and then the base character
 go to http://www.apple.com/feedback and send feedback demanding that they update server and os x to support tls 1.2
no, it is flash memory soldered onto the main circuit board and cannot be changed
you can start the system preferences.app as admin and from that use the network link conditioner.prefpane

this looks like someone near you has a samsung android device with the ability to create a personal wifi hotspot.  your computer wifi is able to detect this so will add it to your list of available networks
ios does have an armenian font and can therefore display unicode armenian in emails, webpages, and text
go to system preferences → keyboard → shortcuts → input sources and define a keyboard shortcut there
i'm not really sure whether the ios discovery algorithm is documented anywhere public in its entirety.  the standard way of doing this though is to setup srv records in dns to let clients know, which servers are available.  for imap (without ssl as you requested) you would setup a srv record such as:  _imap._tcp     srv 0 1 143 imap.mycompany.com.  for pop3 you could have a record like this:  _pop3._tcp     srv 10 1 110 pop3.mycompany.com.  the priority in those two lines are 0 and 10, meaning that the client should prefer imap over pop3.  a different way of going about this could be to add a srv record for microsofts autodiscover mechanism
no,there really is not an easy way to run ppc apps on mac anymore
there is not yet a readily available ios 4.1 jailbreak
yes, there is way
under displays in system preferences there is a checkbox (along with a brightness slider) to enable/disable automatic brightness.   
almost all of the mac developer documentation from apple exists in several places
the symptoms you describe are caused by the preference not getting saved to disk
here is the wikipedia article on the efi system partition.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/efi_system_partition  it says, in part,     the efi system partition is a partition on a data storage device that is used by machines that adhere to the extensible firmware interface
this is because of how retina is implemented on these new systems
if you want to measure the speed (bandwidth) between your ipad and your pc, take a look at iperf
photorec is the best tool i've found for recovering files
the configure script (not directory) is part of the source code archive you should have downloaded (capnproto-c++-x.y.z.tar.gz).  when you unpack that archive, change to the toplevel directory (capnproto-x-y-z) and run the configure command.  $ cd [to where you downloaded the archive] $ tar xzf capnproto-c++-x.y.z.tar.gz $ cd capnproto-c++-x.y.z $ ./configure cxx=$home/clang-3.2/bin/clang++   then run the subsequent commands (make and sudo make install) from that same directory.  this is rather generic - most autotool-based builds work exactly like that. 
in the menu bar, select "store" -> "update itunes match":    the match and upload process will restart. 
sadly the best way to check would be with another whole display assembly
this happened to me when i installed crashplan mac menubar app over a year ago, and when a recent version of crashplan included its own menubar
you can use vnc to remotely control your mac
apple have software at the genius bars which can diagnose faults, read the current voltage, and assess the health of devices but i've never been able to find a copy before.  there is a diagnostic mode for ipods which you can access by resetting the device with menu+select and then upon seeing the apple logo, press rewind+select
beware of legal issues.  you can but you'll need to jailbreak, use extra hardware (plug a mic into the headphone jack), or use 3rd party sip software
lsd in ios is the launchservicedaemon. it provides according to apple     support for launching apps and matching document types to apps
you can use a private.xml like this with keyremap4macbook:  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__consumertokey__ consumerkeycode::music_prev,     keycode::bracket_left, modifierflag::command_l | modifierflag::shift_l&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__consumertokey__ consumerkeycode::music_next,     keycode::bracket_right, modifierflag::command_l | modifierflag::shift_l&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt;   for some keyboards you might need to replace __consumertokey__ consumerkeycode::music_prev with __keytokey__ keycode::vk_consumerkey_music_prev.  see the source for the key code values and predefined settings.

in order to assign a keyboard shortcut to this script, you could create a service in automator.    you must change service receivesto no input
go to system preferences → mission control and make sure that the checkbox for automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use is disabled.    i am able to reproduce your scenario perfectly with this checkbox enabled and disabling this checkbox causes the spaces to be fixed in their position regardless of the switching of window position. 
final cut pro can do that.  so can dvd studio pro.  there are also some free alternatives, most notable: aegisub and jubler.

two things might work in your case:   power off the mac and hope an unerase utility can recover the files before they get overwritten (assuming the restore didn't write over the existing files on disk). delete the folder and try again from a different time machine snapshot.  
afaik there is no way to disable wireless network scanning
you will need a third account to do this trick fully.   make an admin account named differently than the final short name you wish to have in the filesystem for /users/apple2 (the desired "perfect user" with everything matching). log in to the admin account and make one last backup of your system. delete only the account you wish to keep - being careful to keep the home folders - do not let the system delete this home folder, just delete the account without changing the home folder. open terminal and use this command exactly (unless you start with something other than kaleb and end with something other than apple2:    sudo mv /users/kaleb\ \(deleted\)/ /users/apple2     this command uses the \ character to escape the space and the parentheses so be careful to paste it exactly or [chat] here or elsewhere with someone that knows how the unix command line works if you have any doubt about how it will rename one folder by moving it. you can really mess things up in terminal with sudo if you are not prepared to wipe everything and reinstall the os and restore from a backup.  now when you (re)create the apple2 user the os will fix the ownership of the home folder and the short name will match the directory and the long name by making all three "apple2"
you can double-tap to zoom in to a section
that's a finder (on lion) issue and as such, there are no settings to tweak for your problem
some countries (notably japan and south korea) have laws requiring camera phones to make audible shutter sounds
you can   use system preferences/energy settings to define shutdown/restart times run sudo shutdown -r 23:45 to automatically reboot every night combine the second option with a cron/launchd job to reschedule the reboot daily (or just call shutdown -r now from cron/launchd)   you also can set one user to auto-login after reboot in system preferences/users &amp; groups
you should be able to see the os version by going to system preferences > startup disk

the springboard controls the layout of apps on ios and is confused.  generally, it's not a deep corruption of the database (which you fix by restoring the phone, setting up as new and installing things again from scratch) so here are some things to try:   turn on airplane mode in settings app (tells the download process to chill) restart the device (more chilling - starts fresh, frees up ram) connect to itunes   then you should be able to deselect the problem app (removing all traces of the attempted download) and then finally put that app on the device
basically it's a port jdownloader is listening to to make browser integration easier (aka you can add an extension to your favorite browser which then passes urls to jdownloader for downloading).  some details about this flashgot interface can be found here.

since photostream doesn't work for videos, your best bet is probably a 3rd party app.  if you're worried about your pictures being stored on the internet, you might want to try an app such as photosync ($2) or photo transfer app ($3)
the typical process of charging a battery:  first the system detects the power plug.  now the battery status is evaluated and and the battery circuit determines the amount of current to draw
if you are in "album" view, there should still be an "album" placeholder for your podcast, even if you do not have any more episodes stored locally in your computer

why don't you do what it says?  rm -rf /usr/local/cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup ruby -e "$(curl -fssl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homebrew/install/master/install)"   the first line is going to delete homebrew completely and then you should be able to reinstall it.  note: if you do this you'll have to reinstall all the things you installed via homebrew. 
yes, this should be possible using automator
yes there is! captureaudio does exactly this
you can open terminal and use one of the following (rsync would probably be the one for you if you want something that won't be completely lost if you halt the process):  the standard unix way  cp -r -v source/

the headphone jack had a red led glowing inside, which clued me in that it thought there was an optical cable plugged in
the iphone 3g is almost certainly out of warranty by now
no
yes  simply take the original installation disc that came with the mac and re-install osx, afterwards just do a system update to bring it up to the latest version.  when osx is installed over an existing installation, all settings and applications are preserved, and this should resolve all issue with the os.  however, as @kyle pointed out in the comments, the files moved are only header files used for compiling, and should not be affecting the working os, and since the actual os files are not available via the finder, highly unlikely that she copied actual system files, unless she used terminal.  if the applications still don't work after doing this, then those specific applications needs to be re-installed individually

you can wipe the data and return it to factory settings by choosing settings - general - reset
unfortunately, the solution in this case was:  format disk (lose old backups)   now the disk backs up at full speed. 
there are many types of dvi adapter, i could type a load of stuff or just point you at wikipedia.  the key point is that there is no such thing as a dvi adapter
this is deliberate from apple and you will not be able to take screen shots using dvd player.  you can either use vlc and then a screen shot program (cmd-3 and cmd-4 works for me), or transcode your dvd to a quicktime movie using handbrake (which may take too long for you to find it interesting)

 in finder, click go => connect to server... in the server address field, type "afp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" (ip address) or "afp://your-ngnas-name.local" connect using the credentials you use to connect to the time machine service. finder will open a window in /volumes/readynas
power nap, a feature of macbooks that enables them to do more when they are asleep (like back up to icloud/time capsule, check emails, and check imessage) will allow your mac to stop showing messages you've already read when you open your computer
icloud itself does support document revisions, and my understanding is that it does the same job os x does for versions stored locally (keeps track of all the small changes, and is in charge of assembling all the chunks into different versions)

the answer is posted here:  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20111017134102735     to add or modify a category, you have to open the application bundle   ('show package contents', the under the folder contents open the file   'info.plist')
 iphone 5s has full airdrop support, so the problem you're describing is strange, and something i don't have an explanation for
⌘+⌫  pressing command-delete (or perhaps more commonly known as backspace) also does the same trick

the apple tv can replace the aiport express (for audio duties)
two options: (1) using karabiner (formerly keyremap4macbook) which you already have installed, or (2) using bettertouchtool which allows more flexible remapping.  maybe you have an older version without this capability, but update to the latest version of karabiner and you will see an "f10 to volume mute" remap option.    for this problem, bettertouchtool also works well
so you've already set up two-step verification in gmail..
if it supports the standard usb mouse functionality (hid), it should work
this is a tricky thing to troubleshoot since once the itunes tracking database or the ios tracking database gets corrupt - what should sync and work starts to fail.  in the interest of putting out a concrete set of steps, here is how i fix things like this:   make a quick judgment - should i just restore the ios device and start fresh or are there things on the device i need to back up and save? if i need to back things up, now i'm worried my backups might be corrupt too, so run one backup to icloud and one to itunes to be paranoid and safe. then i spend 5 minutes deleting things i don't need on the phone (calendars, mail, contacts that exist in the cloud), game apps that i don't care about losing progress or can re-dowload or sync via icloud. test the sync again. continue spending 5 minutes paring non-essentials and testing until i'm left with just the really important things on the phone

how is your system getting its dns resolutions?  do you have dns servers configured in your router config or in your nic config? if you don't and it is not pushed to your router from your isp maybe try setting them yourself.  use google's dns;   8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4   or opendns;   208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220   if you have custom dns servers set either in your router config or your computer's nic config, maybe those are failing

why would you compile the engine? it is not the full game, so you wouldn't be able to play after compilation.  anyway, if you're still interested, there's a thread on hacker news speaking about it, they also mention how to compile the project if you don't have xcode 3.2  edit: for what is worth, here the instructions for xcode 4. 
macports select can change it back.  the current macports does it using the port select command - older versions had python_select  to see the possible pythons run  port select --list python   from that list choose the one you want and change to it e.g.  sudo port select --set python python25-apple  
i haven't found a way to choose a photo from that popup dialog, but you can add one by dragging an image file onto the picture itself (that dialog may have to be closed for this to work).

in the older ios devices it's the accelerometer - it is detecting the constant acceleration due to gravity.  normal motion produces only short bursts of acceleration, not long enough to trigger rotation.  if you put your ios device in a fast car and accelerated it for several seconds you could probably get it to autorotate the wrong way. 
you can right-click (control-click) on the folder name in the titlebar of the finder window and select a parent folder and or you can expose the path bar in finder (view > show path bar) and select a parent folder from there.  also from the sidebar you can right-click (control-click) on the favorites name and select open enclosing folder, although this opens another finder window whereas the previous suggestions stay within the same finder window.  additionally one should become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts of finder which one can see shown on each menu in finder, particularly the go menu
macbook's don't have the extended keyboard which contains the additional 7 function keys (f13-f19)

try painting the glass with paint, not just the bursts, but the whole plate on the outside. let the paint dry and then scratch the surface clean with a hard plastic object (so you don't scratch the glass). normally the paint will have dried in the bursts and you shouldn't be able to scratch off the paint (while the paint on the glass will be scratched off).  about the electronics; if you use normal paint, it won't harm the electronics

keyboards are 2 layers of plastic film with tiny electric contact, separated by a third layer of plastic film with holes on the spot of every single key. when you press a key, the top and bottom plastic are pressed against one another inside the hole of the middle layer, and the electronic signal going from the top to the bottom layer tells your computer that the key is pressed.  problem is: separation is the same as an average good quality book paper sheet, or maybe the same as the aluminum sheet that makes a soda or beer can

if you are facing a healthy file system at the level of its structure and want to find files which have disk faulty blocks, here is how i would proceed:   make a full backup of your disk with time machine or carbon copy cloner  check this backup. run the following heavy and risky (in case you do have bad blocks outside of your filesystem structure) command:  find / -type f -print -exec dd if={} of=/dev/null bs=1m \;    this heavy find command will print for any plain file its name (thus not reading it, but just its directory entry) and then continue making a full and fast read of all its data blocks.  upon hiting the first file containing bad blocks, this find will cause the kernel to log read error on /var/log/system.log, and it will either slow down or bring your system to a total halt. this will mostly depend on the hard drive capacity to relocate the bad blocks found on its internal pool dedicated to this usual fix task. this file containing bad blocks will be the last name printed by find.  write down this file name on a piece of paper! let's say that this file name is:  /.documentrevisions-v100/.cs/chunkstorage/0/0/0/9   at this point you may have the possibility to kill find quickly by hiting ctrl+c

mac os doesn't have a terminal services centric design, so the loginwindow ties the remote screen resolution tightly to the actual physical screen dimensions.  some easy solutions are to connect the mac to a display (or a display dongle that simulates a plug and play monitor of a resolution of your choosing to the os) so that the os allocates a larger pixel boundary when the user logs in.  alternatively, you could get software like switchresx to force the display to a size of your choosing.

no chance i'm afraid, the limiting factor is software more than anything though, it's possible that an app could be written to talk to said accessory, but using it outside of that app would not be possible unless you are talking about a highly modified jailbroken solution.  unless you already have a device in mind that exists which you actually want to use, i can't imagine anyone creating one, and if they did not by the dock connector, but more likely over a custom bluetooth protocol which is allowed (see the i-cade games cabinet for example of a custom controller using bluetooth that only works with supported apps).  you may be better mentioning what you wish to achieve to allow alternate answers, as i am almost positive that this method will never fly.

the macbook air should have shipped with a small usb drive that contains the installation software.  it won't be easy to do what you want to without booting from something other than the system disk in your mac.  assuming you have the usb drive that shipped with the macbook air (you should have unless there is a good reason why you don't have it), you should insert it and boot from it, by holding the option (alt) key just after you hear the chime when turning the machine on.  after holding the option key for a short while, you will be presented with a choice of boot volumes, one of which should be the os x installer.  run the installer and follow the instructions to reinstall the os, at which point you should be given the option to wipe the current install and start fresh.  if you want extra security, you can use the disk utility while in the installation mode, by choosing it from the utilities menu that is at the top of the screen.  from there you can erase the disk, choosing from a range of security options when doing so.  if you don't have the usb drive you will have to obtain one somehow - which may mean taking the mac to an apple store.  failing that, maybe you'll be able to acquire a install disk image from some place on the web and install it to an external drive that you can boot from

you can add a line like  %admin all = !/bin/rm -rf /   to your sudoers file to prevent the execution of the command with the specific options.  or, if you want to exclude several commands, you can work with command aliases  cmnd_alias dangerous_cmnds=/bin/rm -rf /, /bin/rm -fr / %admin all=!dangerous_cmnds   you can also try to play it safe by using  cmnd_alias dangerous_cmnds=/bin/rm -rf /, /bin/rm -fr /, /bin/rm / *, /bin/rm * /, /bin/rm -rf / *, /bin/rm -rf * /, /bin/rm -fr / *, /bin/rm -fr* / %admin all=!dangerous_cmnds   but there still might be other ways you can shoot yourself in the foot with rm so be careful anyway.  but keep in mind that all matching is done on the full string of the command, so sudo rm -rf /volumes would still work (as would cd /; sudo rm -rf .).  ps: by all means, use sudo visudo to edit the sudoers file and never edit it directly  pps: i obviously didn't test this with rm (only with /bin/echo instead)

unfortunately, firefox (at least the 3.6 version i experimented with) does not disable the command shortcut for quit when you change it in system preferences.  i think the quick and easy fix for this is to add ⌘q as a global shortcut to something else innocuous
hold down ⌘ command while dragging the item out.  i found this lion change interesting; i don't necessarily like it, but i think it mirrors the way that you have to hold down ⌘ when rearranging toolbar items. 
an alternative to grgarside's script, this doesn't need you to restart the finder, just refresh open windows.  can be saved as an app or in automator, as a service. i have it as a service, triggered on  cmd ⌘    h  from system prefs > keyboard > shortcuts > services - which required me to change the 'hide finder' key command in …shortcuts > app shortcuts to something other than default.  to add as service, launch automator then file menu > new. select service in the dialog then drag run applescript to the new automator window. copy/paste the script inside the on run - replacing (* your script goes here *) &amp; save

the recovery partition is created during os x installation.  normally that partition is hidden unless you are using the debug mode in disk utility to show all partitions.  in other words, it should not be showing in your system as it is.  turn off the show all partitions (in debug menu), and check.  if it is still there back it up (for safety) then delete it.  just in case you delete the original recovery partition, you can get it back using the internet recovery, or from reinstalling the os x.  the way it should look like (notice the efi and recovery are grayed out but still showing on the side, since i have the debug show all partition on).

the short nub of the l shaped jack should work nicely to avoid a large lever sticking out of your headphone jack.  i actually prefer a different approach to this problem of leverage - a flexible and much shorter adapter that bends like a tree in the wind rather than breaking as a rigid lever must do.  the monster icablelink adapter is high quality and very inexpensive on the internet.    as you can see there are only the two stereo pins on this adapter so you will lose any microphone (and likely any button control) so you will want to select an adapter to pass those pins through if you need microphone functionality.

no, this is currently not possible due to restrictions with 3rd-party keyboards in ios.  from apple site:     custom keyboards, like all app extensions in ios 8.0, have no access to the device microphone, so dictation input is not possible.  
you can try to run a proxy server locally, and change your network preferences to point to that proxy, and check in the proxy logs to see if the app sends its request through it.  i would suggest using charles. it's quite easy to use: just change our proxy settings in network preferences to either http proxy localhost:8888 or socks proxy localhost:8889, and you should start seeing outgoing requests if you use your browser.  once you do, try using your custom app to see if it sends its request through the proxy or not.  best of luck.

as i understand it you want to alternate between using the imac display to display a) itself b) a connected mbp c) a simultaneously connected mac mini  when you enter target display mode, you do this on the target, i.e
just put in the install dvd. you can do that with the computer running and run the installer from the disc. you can also boot directly to the disc by turning off the computer, putting it in, holding down the c key, and turning the computer on.  follow the directions, and you'll have a clean install
the issue was resolved in the end as follows:   the imac froze and had to be force ably shutdown multiple times on rebooting the dreaded flashing question mark appeared booted into lion recovery mode in disk utility - repaired permissions, reset the partition map   after all that, the machine now starts quickly and applications are much more responsive.  so the moral(s) of the story is/are:   repairing permissions should be done a lot more regularly than every few years :p even after 9 years as a mac owner and power user, even the little things can surprise you  
apparently the only "workaround" is to install logitech control center, use it to pair the devices with the receiver, then uninstall the lcc software.i tried both usb overdrive and mousesteer first, but neither seems to include the necessary pairing functionality
open console and highlight the usbmuxd spam, then click [ignore sender] in the toolbar:    to re-enable usbmuxd spam, click the [^] symbol in the lower bottom left corner then (x):      this will allow you to safely ignore any console spam you would like without actually disabling anything other than the message that you see in console. 
if "put back" is disabled for a multiple-item selection it means that (at least) one of the items selected doesn't have its original location information stored in the trash directory's .ds_store file
[repeating my comment as an answer to close the question]  when you update a setting using defaults, it generally only affects the current user." http://commandlinemac.blogspot.com/2008/12/defaults-setting-preferences-from.html  so i can just run   defaults write com.google.keystone.agent checkinterval 0   on each of the non-admin accounts where the pop-up is bothersome. 
you cannot safely remove it without the proper tool and the correct touch
there isn't a general one place to change these and when you do, it's typically with software additions that make the system less stable.  you would have better luck changing them on a per-application basis since that is less disruptive of injecting custom code across all applications
 go to http://localhost:631/printers select your printer from the list. choose set default options from the administration drop-down. set the options you would like as default.  
ok, after twiddling different combinations, i found a solution that works (at least on mac os x 9.5 mavericks)
if you are not afraid of using terminal, you can run  rsync -a --progress /path/to/pictures /volumes/external/pictures/  
numbers seems to use the decimal separator selected in system preferences:    i didn't find any way to use both comma and period as decimal separators though.  note that if you change the region from the menu at the top, it also affects things like the default values of locale variables in terminal and iterm. 
it’s a matter of having the right settings in your ~/.vimrc file
on os-x mountain-lion, i can option-click one of the "eject" icons (hold down option, then click the eject icon), and all external partitions will eject.  (update) this has been verified to also work on os x mavericks, as i suspected it would

you don't need to download a song on your ios devise via itunes match to get its artwork updated on that device
there is absolutely no way that you should even think about doing any of this without a complete backup on a separate disk
the first thing you should do is make sure that your model ipad supports the cellular network you're trying to connect to.  in america, we have two major cellular networks, gsm and cdma
yes, it is possible to download the bootcamp drivers outside of the bootcamp tool:  update :    apple have published a table of 'which download you need for which model' at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5634 for winxp, see robmathers' answer.   the hard way, taken from     http://www.cafe-encounter.net/p682/download-bootcamp-drivers is, i think, no longer needed.   download from apple the http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog file
the app store should show a list of apps in the update tab that have been updated, with details such as when it was updated, the changelog and a button to open the app.   
it turns out that this issue was cased by a network problem
to connect to a proxy server (which is what you're trying to do) you need no special programm just tell your system to send all the traffic over the proxy.  you can do this inside of your mac's system preferences under network  if you need more information on how i suggest you to read the official apple support document: https://support.apple.com/kb/ph18553

there are a couple easy ways to identify the trojan in it's current form (aside from downloading directly from adobe or using av software):   the trojan is an installer package that opens with installer.app, the real installer is an application (it doesn't use installer.app)
no, there is no way to create or edit contact groups on ios
i would use lingon to script this as a system startup - you can always use launchd to load or unload the job from the command line (or delete the route).  you don't need lingon, it just makes it so much more friendly to assemble a plist that launchd likes to run. 
there may be other ways to do this, but a simple way would be to create your own homepage, which could look anyway you like
screencapture -t 5 /tmp/screencapture.png # 5 second delay screencapture -t 5 -cc # -c copies to clipboard, -c includes a cursor screencapture -t 5 -ic # -i (interactive mode) is like shift-command-4   i also use a function like this:  screencaps() {   while :; do     screencapture -c ~/desktop/$(date +%y%m%d%h%m%s).png     sleep ${1-1}   done }  
as answered in the comment by bispymusic, this was resolved by using a dvi->hdmi adaptor or cable

finder has a menu item found under go ("go to folder…") where you can type a full path.  the command+shift+g keyboard shortcut makes it handy to summon.   
or you could follow the advice of red sweater^1 and use applescript + fastscript/sparkle
you could use a mail rule to redirect them to a specific folder, that will stop the notification, if your prefs are set accordingly. this is an example from my gateway notifications, which i don't need dinging &amp; notifying every hour...    stop evaluating as the last step if you want no further action, otherwise the next rules will be applied, down the list.  to stop them also making the new mail sound, i switch that off in prefs, then add this last rule, right at the end, for any mail that wasn't redirected by a rule on the way through...    to complete the setup, set these 2 prefs...

no - you might retain a copy of the application by transferring it to itunes in case you take legal action to arbitrate or ask the courts to assist you with your contract with your developer.  apple doesn't receive code from developers when an app is submitted (test flight submissions work the same as app store submissions) - just the compiled program. 
import/export works differently in xcode 5+
macs fan control does the job well
specifically for the gamed service, the following command in one of the posts about a similar topic on the apple support communities worked for me, without any need to modify plists or rename files:  sudo defaults write /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.gamed disabled -bool true   changing "true" back to "false" will re-enable it, although i've not tried it. 
not sure it'll do everything you've asked for, but time sink is pretty powerful and can generate a variety of reports
i'm not exactly certain how i managed it, but a combination of these may be at least part of the fix...   in image capture, set "connecting this xxx opens" to 'no application' (if you don't see that option, click the tiny reveal button at the bottom left)      using rcdefaultapp to set all media options to 'ignore'    
i solved this by writing a python script
the problem appears to have been my copy of the installer that i had stashed away in a folder in my home directory, even though i'd originally made it by keeping a copy of the installer in /applications (it was even owned by my user account instead of root!).  once i removed that installer, the mac app store was happy to start the download for a new one.

to recalibrate your iphones battery, you should:   use the iphone until it shuts off due to low battery. charge it, without interruptions, to full charge (100%). reset the iphone by holding home and the power buttons at the same time
you could use a software like caffeine to easily achieve your need :  caffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar
the output from defaults read is sent to standard output in human readable format.  the output from defaults export is put in the file that you specify in the command in binary format.  the problem with your defaults export example:    you redirected the standard output to the file: ~/desktop/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist (using >) and defaults export doesn't send anything to standard output; the result was a file that had nothing in it. defaults export requires that you specify an output file in the command
if you keep your files in the os-x file system and share those folders with your guest - as in your z: drive example - you can access them from either os (or both, if you're careful), plus however you backup os-x will also back up your changed xp files without its having to backup your entire guest vdd for a (e.g.) one-line edit

yes your settings are transferable and will be transferred using apple's migration assistant, apps too and as the g5 and g4 are both power pc apps your apps should transfer over as well.  you could even transfer your settings (but not your apps) to a modern intel-based mac. 
no - macs ship with one license to lion - for that mac.  if you buy an upgrade outright, that applies to all your macs. 
if you clear you partition using disk utility and then boot into internet recovery or install from another location (for example a usb flash drive) you should be fine, os x will only be installed (and only effect) the partition you choose to install it on at the start of the installation process.

it can be difficult it if was done stealthily (for example - it's fairly easy to hide things like cydia) - my approach would be to see if ibooks or skype work - ibooks has historically been broken by jailbreaks and skype is designed to prevent use on a jailbroken device (which is annoying if you want to use skype, but excellent if you want to know if you are on a jailbroken device).

you should be able to run the command sudo killall python
your frustration with the finder is a worldwide sport :) finder does make things harder sometimes
the bottleneck is the available free memory (ram) on the iphone.  if safari starts running out of memory it will flush the contents of older tabs meaning they have to reload when you switch back to them.  if you have too many tabs open, or you simply have multiple tabs that each have a large web page in them, safari will reload when you switch back to another tab
no, apple didn't implement the gift feature in the mac app store
for existing (or the one you get from others) excel documents where you have a lots of data in it, try using the down arrow (under the format window).  it will open new window where you can choose a new format there

the most common use of admin with server.app is to run server.app and administer the server itself.  if that's what you want, use server.app to tick the administer this server box:   
there is no built-in way to do this, but some poking around turned up this article, which basically involves modifying the entourage script to use outlook instead
this issue has been removed with the latest chrome update (18.0.1025.142).  you can read more about the update here:   stable channel release 18.0.1025.142

have a look at move files using just keyboard in mac finder? for a discussion of the same topic, listing a lot of options.  assuming you are running lion you can move files by using cmd-c to pick them up and cmd-opt-v to move them to the target location
ask siri "who am i?", and then scroll down.   
no, your speech is still sent to the siri/nuance servers for processing, so you can't use dictation without an internet connection.  an alternative would be to use a third-party dictation app like dragon dictate.  while your machine is probably powerful enough to handle conversion (although maybe not as quickly as apple's servers), it makes a lot of sense for apple to keep things on their end
the problem indeed was with synchronisation: my imac had this account configured as name@company.com, while mba had this account configure as name.alias@company.com
first make sure your external hd is attached
my first instinct is to suggest using imap and just keeping all your mail etc on the server
andrew choi's simpledockclock does this, although it is not straightforward to change the style.  it looks like this:    the source code and a binary are available. 
so, the reason for this was that my isp is filtering dns requests on port 53
have you checked out the built in screen sharing in os x? check out system preferences -> sharing -> screen sharing
it appears that this is linked to spotlight in some way.  i recently turned spotlight indexing back on for the volume holding my $home and immediately this started working again.  i assume that without the spotlight index it can't find the archive directly automatically, then finds it via imap when i run through the steps in the question. 
yes, you're just syncing the app's data with icloud, as no files are leftover when an app is deleted
yes, it turned out you can do this
after quite a tedious research it seems that there is no easy way to edit the description of the private key, so basically unless apple enhances their keychain access application there is no way to distinguish between multiple digital ids imported into the same key chain.  it also looks like google chrome (and chromium) have implemented some key management routines and are managing the descriptions of imported private keys
using the built-in tool "automator", you can define a workflow to batch rename files.  to do that, you will have to:   open automator find it using spotlight or in /applications create a new workflow type get into the search field  scroll to the bottom of the list of items and drag get specified item from the files &amp; folders actions list on the left panel and drop it into the right panel click the add button and find your files add the sort finder items action followed by rename finder items it the "rename finder items" panel, select "make sequential" and "add number to" picture hit the play button and you should be done   have a look here or here for an example tutorials on your specific renaming task at hand

it should be possible to do the clean install of a windows 8 pro upgrade on an existing installation of an earlier qualifying os as these steps for windows 7 suggest:  http://www.tuaw.com/2009/11/02/an-illustrated-guide-to-boot-camp-and-windows-7/  in this guide above, search for string: "theoretically, you're doing a fresh installation of windows 7
no, there is no way to do that in the current build. 
following up on the comment above by @patrix it seems the problem is that my playlist references another playlist, and it's simply that the error message that itunes gives me is wrong.  this question has more information on the issue. 
i've had several people ask for help with apple music and this has helped them - hopefully it's what you're looking for.  stars are tracked in your music library - so if you are playing songs from the cloud - it's a bug if you can input stars for tracks that are not part of your actual library.  one you add a song/album to your library - the stars should be there for you to rate things.  hearts are tracked in the cloud - so you should always be able to use that control whether you are streaming a radio song that's not even in apple music for download, streaming apple music or playing a song that's in your library due to purchase, rip, or music addition. 
on snow leopard, you would need to boot from an external os to wipe the drive.  on mountain lion (or lion), the system makes a recovery hd so you can self-wipe the mac
 navigate to / (e.g
you don't need to put anything in there if you're working locally, just click 'open directory utility' [which you did, based on your second pic]  then… edit menu - enable root user [only available once you unlock directory utility, which it looks like you did]  ...i would wonder why you need root unlocked - you really don't need it in os x, you can sudo anyway 
i generally think the command idea is a bad one, because it is intended to be the system key for app manipulation

for others who have this problem, the error fixed itself after a few days during a sync. 
send to yourself - some mailers won't send if there's no 'to' recipient mail.app actually will, so you could optionally leave the to field blank - though i'd test that your isp allows it through as well, before relying on that.  then send to the group as bcc bcc stands for blind carbon copy, as opposed to cc which is just carbon copy i.e
both carbon copy cloner and superduper can clone and omit files or directories from the clone.

apple (or a 3rd party) should write a utility to allow you to dial down the native resolution of the internal camera, but to my knowledge they have not, so far.  you can work around this by piping the video output from your web camera into another program that processes the camera's video stream and "re-publishes" it to your mac as a virtual camera (aka pseudo-camera) which will be available for use in other applications on your mac.    here's how i did it
go into finder and right click on the dvd, there should be an option "erase rewritable disk"
it would be easier to use an alias like this:  alias et="(shopt -s nullglob; find ~/.trash /volumes/*/.trashes/501 -mindepth 1 -delete)"   rm -rf ~/.trash/* doesn't work if the list of filenames is longer than getconf arg_max, and it doesn't include files that start with a period

so lets compare the i5 family of cpu on mbp.  the i5 is a brand name for a family of processor, that is why is it still called i5.  core i5" 2.4 13-inch (late 2011) features a 32 nm "sandy bridge" 2.4 ghz intel "core i5" processor (2435m), with two independent processor "cores" on a single silicon chip with a 3 mb shared level 3 cache.  the 2015 mbp has up to 2.9ghz dual-core intel core i5 processor (turbo boost up to 3.3ghz) with 3mb shared l3 cache.  based on this alone the 2015 model is >30% faster. 
exchange activesync 12.1 (introduced with exchange server 2007 sp1, released on nov 29 2007) added a policy called mail body truncation size (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exchange_activesync#exchange_activesync_12.1).  this is a server-side policy that can be enforced for a group of users, as stated in the microsoft exchange documentation (see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123484%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx):     exchange activesync mailbox policies let you apply a common set of policy or security settings to a user or group of users.

usually things like that are caused by browser extensions or an odd interaction between a specific browser version and the code on the site.  have you looked over the basic support page for the developer forums?  https://developer.apple.com/support/resources/developer-forums.html  it has a "contact us" form if you can't solve this by ensuring an up to date (and unmodified) version of safari isn't rendering the web site properly for you.

since os x has no package manager, anything you install would have been manual, through macports or through installer.  if you want a list of the binaries your terminal has access to, you can run the following commands to check the most common spots, and output the result as a text file:  touch ~/binaries.txt ls /usr/bin &gt; ~/binaries.txt ls /usr/sbin &gt;&gt; ~/binaries.txt ls /usr/local/bin &gt;&gt; ~/binaries.txt ls /usr/local/sbin &gt;&gt; ~/binaries.txt ls /opt/local/bin &gt;&gt; ~/binaries.txt ls /opt/local/sbin &gt;&gt; ~/binaries.txt   alternatively, if you just want to get the packages installed by macports, run the following (this is probably the one you want):  touch ~/macports.txt port installed &gt; ~/macports.txt   and for homebrew:  touch ~/homebrew.txt brew list &gt; ~/homebrew.txt   and finally, for all packages installed by installer  touch ~/installedpackages.txt pkgutil --packages &gt; ~/installedpackages.txt   to restore, for example, your macports ports from the list generated above, use the following:   port install $(cat ~/macports.txt)

$ type ctags ctags is /usr/bin/ctags $ type -p ctags /usr/bin/ctags   the second form is useful for doing things like  $ file $(type -p ctags) $ ls -l $(type -p ctags)    and is often aliased to which.    if you don't want to rely on bash functionality and prefer an external command, /usr/bin/whereis serves a similar purpose:     the whereis utility checks the standard binary directories for the specified programs, printing out the paths of any it finds.   because whereis doesn't use $path but rather the result of sysctl user.cs_path it may lead to different results.

you should boot on the recovery hd and use terminal there to unlock the drive using the recovery key (you can't check the recovery key if you are booted on the crypted disk, since the unlocking process will fail: already unlocked).  to start with, you will need to identify the logical volume uuid of the encrypted drive using the diskutil corestorage list command:  diskutil corestorage list   running that command will give you a listing of all core storage volumes.   once you have the uuid of the encrypted volume, you can then unlock the encrypted volume using the following commands:  diskutil corestorage unlockvolume uuid   when prompted enter the passphrase you would like to test.  this article provides more information and screenshots, unlock or decrypt your filevault 2-encrypted boot drive from the command line.

note - it's not entirely clear which photos you mean, i'm assuming you're talking about photos in albums created by apps like hipstamatic, line camera, phototoaster, etc.   i think the official answer is itunes somehow (on the app screen, the data section, bla bla bla), but i've found that not every app works well with it

this issue is most likely something to do with gmail and it's syncing
optionspace inserts a non-breaking space (nbsp, u+00a0) by default.  what i've done i've set my editor highlight the non-breaking space, so that i see when i accidentally enter it.  you could remap ⌥␣ to a normal space by creating ~/library/keybindings/ and saving a property list like this as defaultkeybinding.dict:  {     "~ " = (inserttext:, " "); }  
you could use mdfind, which uses the spotlight database
thanks to sacrilicious identifying the actual file/key where the data is stored, i figured out how to copy the whole thing with a few terminal commands.  make sure you don't have system preferences open while doing this, or it may not work!   on your old install, run /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -x -c "print nsuserreplacementitems" ~/library/preferences/.globalpreferences.plist &gt; backup.plist  this saves the substitutions to the backup.plist file in whatever directory you ran that command from (by default, your home directory).  copy that backup.plist file to your new install (i recommend your home directory for simplicity). on the new install, run /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -c "delete nsuserreplacementitems" ~/library/preferences/.globalpreferences.plist, then run /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -c "add nsuserreplacementitems array" ~/library/preferences/.globalpreferences.plist  this wipes the default substitution list and creates a new blank one.  again on the new install, run /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -c "merge /path-to-backup/backup.plist nsuserreplacementitems" ~/library/preferences/.globalpreferences.plist, first replacing the /path-to-backup/backup.plist part with the actual path to wherever you saved the backup file.   that should do it

i think if all you're doing is telling your friends about your app and encouraging them to post honest reviews in the app store, that's probably fine.  if, however, you were trying to get your friends who'd never even used the app to positively review it in the app store, that would probably be considered a breach of that rule. 
take a look at this superuser question how can i shutdown a windows machine remotely from os x?
turns out this is symptomatic of a sata cable issue
that error doesn't explicitly say that the certificates are outdated does it?  it looks to me like it is complaining that the certs are not where they are supposed to be (or potentially they can't be read).  found this on google:  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/curlphp-2005-11/0038.html  to summarize the poster suggests either using the -k flag with curl to suppress this error (this is obviously less secure) or make sure that what ever process is calling curl has execute access to all directories on the path to the certificates. 
update: i have discussed this with someone who has specifically tried this
open the file in preview  now click on edit  in edit menu bar click on the last icon looks like a square with line from corner to corner.  in the new window you can adjust the size and the resolution.

no, each time machine backup disk will backup the same set of items.  from apple support page on using multiple backup disks:     if you designated items that shouldn’t be backed up, the list of excluded items applies to all backup disks.   if you feel that your backup is too large, you can exclude some unnecessary files from time machine backups, for example:   the applications folder – apps store their data elsewhere, so you will still be backing up all application data. the /system directory – contains system files for os x, probably not data that you may need to have a copy of.  
i couldn't find any information on this issue, so i called apple

you can use the text replacement feature os x has
the view > allow mouse reporting menu item does not enable the terminal mouse reporting behavior, it merely controls whether mouse reporting is allowed.  this gives the user a means to temporarily bypass mouse reporting when it has been enabled by application programs, to interact with the terminal view for short periods of time
ok, so further to my previous answer, i can walk you through getting cron (a built in unix schedule service) to run a scheduled shutdown command for you.  it will run as root and will be forced.   open terminal (/applications/utilities/terminal) input sudo crontab -e   you'll need to enter your login password and then press enter.  you'll now be in a text editor (vim)
you're right that the activate command raises all windows
from the macrumors forums you can hold shift when you launch a program to launch it without the resume previous window functionality.     alternatively, for those who want some resume functionality and don't   want to globally disable it, you can hold shift when you launch an   application to bypass resume and start that app fresh.   if that doesnt work you can turn off the function globally by going to system preferences -> general and unticking "restore windows when quitting and reopening apps"  (you can also disable the function on a per-app basis using the instructions here) 
there is a command line utility called duti which can do this.  http://duti.sourceforge.net/  there is no easy way to do this using built-in commands. 
you can buy the ml from app store.  then install it on usb following these instructions from apple-ht202796.  then hold the option key during boot to select the start up disk.  how ever, running from usb disk can be slow.  alternative->better solution is to create a new partition (size to be determined) and install the ml on it, if you are using the ml frequently.

there is no "snow lion"—snow leopard, lion, and mountain lion strike me as possibilities—but regardless, the answer is the same: you can roll back with your time machine to an earlier version of os x:   enter recovery by rebooting and holding command+r. select "restore from a time machine backup". select a backup from before your mavericks upgrade.   unfortunately, you may not be able to use all of today's data from a pre-mavericks installation

you have just identified why directories were invented to allow one server to define for a group of computers what users belong to which groups so that when sharing files, the permissions match so that computer y will see the restrictions hosted from computer z properly.  the first step is to decide how and where you will enforce the mapping of users to groups so that you can then set up sharing in a way that will work for you.  you'll want to decide if unix permissions (number based users and groups) is workable or if you need real acl

by default there is no way to set the priority of a reminder within the text.  there is a least one third-party app that was designed to do this, called (appropriately enough) addtoreminders, though it seems to have been abandoned, and you would need to compile the app yourself using xcode. 
edit: it looks like there is a solution described here.    i don't know of a solution, but i'd bet if anything could do this, it would be ukelele.     ukelele can assign multiple-character   strings and can create "dead keys",   where a keystroke sets a new state   that modifies the output of the   following keystroke.   possibly combined with an automator app

if by “all the configurations for bash didn’t work” you mean that customizations made in ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.profile or ~/.login) aren’t taking effect, that’s because bash is being invoked as a non-login shell (it runs ~/.bashrc instead).  to make it a login shell, the simplest solution is to add the -l option:  bash -l   alternatively, if you want to actually create a login session you can invoke it via the login command

you can’t, those are different formulae, and homebrew doesn’t allow you to install a previous version of a formula.  the workaround is to remove gcc, then go back in homebrew’s history (remember that it’s a git repository), get the gcc formula as it was before the 5.1.0 upgrade, install it, then upgrade gcc to get the latest version.  the 5.1.0 gcc upgrade was done in homebrew commit 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab:  $ cd $(brew --prefix) $ git show -s 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab commit 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab author: david christenson &lt;david@the-david.com&gt; date:   sat may 2 18:58:17 2015 -0600      gcc 5.1.0      update to latest stable release, add option and patch for jit, remove cloog dependency,     refactor language selection, add head, use https mirror.   you need to checkout the parent commit:  $ git checkout 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab^   then get the gcc formula and save it somewhere:  $ brew cat gcc &gt; /tmp/gcc.rb   if you’re lazy i put this formula online here

this is a legitimate bug with siri: http://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/24/siri-delivering-wrong-weather-forecasts-for-common-city-names/  the bug has to be fixed on apple's end (or yahoo's, or wherever exactly the problem is occurring).  but you can work around it temporarily by asking for the weather in "zip code 10028" (or whatever)

that's what i think apple suggests when you need to store you macbook for longer periods:    discharge your battery to 50% and keep the laptop in a cool place if you plan to not use the computer for more than 5 months take the battery off the laptop you will probably need to charge the battery every 6 months to better preserve it
either upgrade your bash (homebrew) or you'll have to recode it using a series of if statements:  case "$ostype" in linux-gnu*) ;;&amp; linux*) echo $ostype; ;; esac case "$ostype" in linux-gnu*) ;&amp; linux*) echo $ostype; ;; esac   would be  # first case if [[ $ostype == linux-gnu* ]]; then     : # nothing in this branch fi  if [[ $ostype == linux* ]]; then     echo $ostype fi  # second case function print_ostype { echo $ostype; } if [[ $ostype == linux-gnu* ]]; then     # nothing in this branch     # include the next branch     print_ostype elif [[ $ostype == linux* ]]; then     print_ostype fi   i used a function in the 2nd case to reduce code duplication, in case there's multiple statements.

if you're located outside the us, itunes match is unavailable for the time being, due to content licensing deals.  when itunes match was first announced i believe apple stated they would be working on bringing it to more countries, but these negotiations always take some time
how to use wireless beaming  the first step is to install iphoto on two ios devices such as an iphone and an ipad on which iphoto is compatible
i do not have alfred installed however i would think the following method should work.  for example, using the script editor set to javascript the following code returned my login name.  objc.import('stdlib') $.getenv('logname')   so, i'd assume that if "alfred_version" is the actual environment variable, then the following might work as well.  objc.import('stdlib') $.getenv('alfred_version')  
simply the answer is: you can not change because of the update

all this hype about how to charge your batteries is blown out of proportion.  although some batteries (i forget which types exactly) can have longer lives if charged at "optimal" rates and temperatures, the reality seems to be that it does not extend the life by much
it should automatically snap to midpoint if you manually move it there. 
you can reinstall the os back to the same version that it shipped with by using the restore discs that came with your mac to wipe your disk and reinstall mac os x.  however, just because apple has officially dropped support for xp and vista with boot camp doesn't mean it will stop working - the most likely situation will be that new computers will have hardware that apple will only provide windows 7 drivers for

open the two pdfs with preview  drag the thumbnails of the second pdf to the end of the first pdf but above the grey line (marked with the red arrow):      and finally export the resulting pdf to a third pdf.  if your first pdf contains just one page this doesn't work.  workaround 1: open your second pdf, then open the first pdf, drag the single page to the beginning of the second pdf and export the resulting pdf to a third pdf.  workaround 2: insert an empty second page at the end of the first page.      and drag the second pdf to the regular end of your first pdf    delete the empty page at the end and export the remaining pages to a new third pdf. 
you need specific software to open .icontainer files, e.g

after a bit of research (in the stores themselves, using google, and in the apple developer program resources), i'm rather sure no list of these is available from apple themselves or from any third party.  i found the best ways to find the apps tagged as "essentials," is to look in these places:   both the mac app store and the itunes app store have a link on their front page called "new to the (mac) app store?" most apps listed there, which are not games, have the "essentials" badge
i find the best way to install node.js is to use nvm, which allows you to install and manage multiple versions of node.  i use homebrew for pretty much everything else, but node is easier to use through nvm, since it doesn't use global folders - everything is in your home directory, and you can easily switch between node versions.  to install (check the website for the latest version):  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash   there are some specific notes about os x on the web site, please make sure to read through those, e.g

do this:   all devices need the new notes upgrade to be compatible with this. update to new notes on each device. open folders view and select local notes or on my phone. tap on edit in the upper right corner and tap on move all in the lower left corner. you should see this:   icloud  new folder  'notes 0 >' [or not including the local notes]   tap on notes   they will empty out of the local notes folder and move into icloud.  again, you won't see any of these notes until you upgrade to new notes.  pro-tip: this also works for migrating gmail notes, etc.

here's what apple says:     because of how find my mac works, you must deselect the box next to find my mac in the os x system preferences > icloud pane to remove your device from your icloud find my iphone, ipad, ipod touch, or mac device list.   one of the ways this persistence is implemented is by writing a find my mac token to nvram, the persistent memory in intel macs
after trying various techniques the only solution i've found is to connect the time machine volume to a machine with a newer version of os x and run tmutil from the command line, i believe any version from lion onwards should have this

i don't think there is a way to share history amongst terminaltabs only, but here something that could help you.  the history is not something handle by your terminal but by your shell (bash, tcsh, zsh...)  here some options that'll help you setup a shared history amongst all the terminal windows (the shell instances).  this should be put somewhere in your .bashrc file.  export histcontrol=ignoredups:erasedups  # no duplicate entries export histsize=100000                   # big big history export histfilesize=100000               # big big history shopt -s histappend                      # append to history, don't overwrite it  # save and reload the history after each command finishes export prompt_command="history -a; history -c; history -r; $prompt_command"

according to the store pages, it looks like all the retina models have 8gb memory, with option for more, and as such you should choose the 64-bit version to make sure you can take advantage of all that memory in windows.  a 32-bit windows installation would only be able to use 2gb/3gb of the available memory.

all the files are still there, you just can't get at them since the mount point has changed the system's ability to resolve files in /users/whatever (a.k.a.~)  going forward, try mounting the drive under /volumes (as in sudo ext4fuse /dev/disk2s7 /volumes/mydrive)  you should probably reboot the mac since many programs will have issues saving work to the home folder
itunes deduces the color of the iphone from the serial number he finds on the logic board
you can use traditional unix tools to start monitoring now.  iostat 60 | tee /tmp/iostat_60.log   the free space statistics can be generated with the df command, but you might just set your warning levels on server app and rely on alerts to notify you when space fills
try this in terminal  mkdir ${tmpdir}/com.apple.iconservices   this recreates the com.apple.iconservices directory, which apparently gets itself deleted from time to time. 
from a pragmatic standpoint, yes you can probably trust the average genius team (since the machine will be under the watch of many people while it is out of your possession)
the issue is that the calendar needs to be made public
you should parse the output of hdiutil, and mount the filesystems you're interested in - because you can't do what you're trying to do with mount.  the first few lines of the man page show supported syntax:   mount [-adfruvw] [-t lfs | external_type]  mount [-dfruvw] special | node  mount [-dfruvw] [-o options] [-t lfs | external_type] special node   notice for -a, there are no options to specify a node path, which makes your command invalid syntax.  (also, i'd suggest testing with a proper image file - one that is an actual cd image

how to avoid re-downloading everything again?   your apps by default are downloaded to the location 'c:\users\username\music\itunes\itunes media\mobile applications'
you should be able to do this by unloading the kernel extension (kext) that controls the trackpad from the command line.  sudo kextunload /system/library/extensions/appleusbtopcase.kext/contents/plugins/appleusbtrackpad.kext to disable it

the last version of the os to use this font as default was system 7.     for mac os 8, apple decided to discard this wonderful part of their   brand’s identity, and commissioned david berlow of the font bureau to   design charcoal.   apple actually released system 7 for free download here

you actually cannot
it really depends on the application, so there is no correct a) or b) solution that would encompass all your apps.  many mac apps are 'installed' by the simple expedient of copying the app from a disk image to the applications folder. so long as your new install uses the same apple id as your old &amp;/or you have any required activation keys, all is good.  the issue arises with apps that needed to run as an installer, asking permissions to modify system items, install background processes etc
/usr/local/library/linkedkegs seems to contain a list of, well, linked kegs, so this should do the trick:  ls -1 /usr/local/library/linkedkegs | while read line; do     echo $line     brew unlink $line     brew link --force $line done   i'd recommend ensuring you have write permissions to /usr/local/lib again before trying this. 
man spctl  that is good to know, although you can just do:  xattr -d yourfile.txt  this removes the quarantine attribute on files.  with spctl you can add writeroom to list of apps that can run

unless you’re running a firewall behind a nat router (which serves no point), bonjour’s enabled and running by default. it’s used to discover and connect to other devices within your local network configuration (think of that w2p button on a router - it’s apple’s software equivalent)

i don't have this issue, pressing the enter key also works instead of space.  i created a custom text substitution in language &amp; text, then opened textedit and it worked on any key press, not just space or enter. 
source of the problem  by studying the processes spawned by internetsharing (with the help of opensnoop and debugging shell scripts) i finally build a way to circumvent this systematic and stupid overwriting of /etc/bootpd.plist.  internetsharing creates a minimal /etc/bootpd.plist and then spawns 2 processes:  /usr/libexec/bootpd /usr/libexec/natpmpd   solution  i replaced the original bootpd by a simple shell script in charge of putting my source of /etc/bootpd.plist in place before firing the original bootpd code
if it is your app, you should probably notify apple

i personally prefer using web sharing and installing only mysql server, just to stick with the  mac os x apache setup.  web sharing has support for php, all you need to do is remove the comment (#) from the following line of the file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:  #loadmodule php5_module      libexec/apache2/libphp5.   so it becomes:  loadmodule php5_module      libexec/apache2/libphp5.so   the php module includes mysql support, so you just need to install the mysql server, turn it on and then you are ready to go.  after turning web sharing on, put your .php files inside your personal site folder, and access it on your browser using the address informed on the web sharing activation screen, inside settings. 
if you are using a 27 inch imac (mid 2010) then you need a mdp to mdp cable.  according to apple's support page, use your imac as a display with target display mode, you can accomplish this with the cable referenced above, but only with a 27" imac if you are using the mid 2010 model.

after running this command,   find ~ -type f -exec grep "special search string" {} \; -print   i was able to find the conversation history at  /users/&lt;my_mac_user_id&gt;/documents/microsoft user data/microsoft communicator history/&lt;my_communicator_login_id&gt;   just copying the entire folder to new mac solved my problem.  "special search string" is an unique string you would have used while chatting with your friends/colleagues. 
sizeup  you could have a look at sizeup, which has been recommended on apple.se at least once before - it has some nice keyboard tools for throwing windows around multiple monitors (as i use it) and also for throwing them around multiple 'spaces'.  it's not free, but it's very useful and certainly worth the small registration fee. 
basically all apps will be closed when shutting down, simply because the computer will be turned off

so i decided to research "apache" without specifying "os x" in my research.  i found that you can change the listen port in a conf file  $ mdfind httpd-ssl.conf      # found     # /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-ssl.conf  $ cd /private/etc/apache2.extra $ sudo nano httpd-ssl.conf      # ctrl + w     # 443      # change listen 443 to listen 4444     # ctrl + o     # ctrl + x   note: enabling root would allow you to listen on port 444 
yes, this is possible

if you change your account's password using your mac os x install disc (or if your network-based account password is changed due to a network admin forcing a password change), your default keychain password (which uses the same initial password as your user account) does not change.  support apple helps:  if you want your default keychain to be unlocked automatically when you log in, synchronize your keychain access and account login passwords by doing this:   open keychain access (you can get to it by choosing utilities from the go menu in the finder). from the edit menu, choose change password for keychain "login." type the former password of the account that you are currently logged in to, then click ok. if you entered the correct password, a new window appears; enter the original password again in the current password field. in the new password field, type the password that matches your current account password. re-enter the newer password in the verify field, then click ok.   if you don't remember your original (former) account password  if you don't remember your original password, you'll need to delete the keychain

this osxdaily article disable “reopen windows when logging back in” in mac os x lion completely describes a method of doing this.     you may have noticed that when you log out or reboot mac os x lion,   you get a dialog window with a checkbox next to “reopen windows when   logging back in” that restores all of your currently open applications   and windows.      if you don’t like it and you’re tired of unchecking the box to no   longer reopen the windows, you can use a third party script to render   the feature useless

as initially mentioned by neil, the apple publications style guide is the place to look.  from page 34:        what to capitalize: follow these rules when you use title-style capitalization.   capitalize every word except:      articles (a, an, the), unless an article is the first word or follows a colon   coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, and so)   the word to in infinitives (how to start your printer)   the word as, regardless of the part of speech   words that always begin with a lowercase letter, such as ipod and itunes   prepositions of four letters or fewer (at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over, to, up, and with), except when the word is part of a verb phrase or is used as another part of speech (such as an adverb, adjective, noun, or verb).   starting up the computer   logging in to the server   getting started with your macbook pro         that is, the i in words like ipod and itunes (and imac, iphone, ipad, etc.) are never capitalized.  i don't believe that, given a choice, apple ever uses all caps, although the only specific rule i've found is on page 33:     don’t use all caps for emphasis.

this article explains how to use the command line softwareupdate tool to perform updates: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht200113.  i tested it on my system and it appears to work as a local user as long as you have sudo access to your system. 
since the error that showed up the first time was just can't open (resource busy), i wouldn't worry about it
i guess it depends more on your creativity than on the tools you use
since hacking the actual install process is quite painful in terms of time and knowledge required, most people image rather than do the work to change the actual os installer.  for this, you will want to use a packaging / deployment tool if you do this professionally
i still don't know why it was doing this, but i've since set itunes to automatically delete played podcasts after 1 day, and stopped deleting them manually
yes you can delete anything in the cache folder

you don't mention what version of mac os x you're running, but if you're running a version between 10.4 and 10.9.x, then fseventer may be useful if you're trying to see what files and ports are accessed while you launch, use, or quit an application. 
i filed a bug report (#11891721) for this
it's there as a placeholder so that scripts that look for it know where to insert their changes into the profile file.  i beleive this was from the default profile created on much older versions of osx, since my .profile which has moved with me from panther has this, but my work machine which is from the leopard/snow leopard era does not.  i have seen links to such articles going back to 2005.  it could also have been added by a third party installer, but finding out which one is probably a zero-sum game.

use pmset to change the darkwakes parameter:  sudo pmset -c darkwakes 1   the darkwakes parameter is not mentioned in the man page, but it is shown by pmset -g if your mac supports power nap and is operating on an ac power.  -c is ac power (or charger or wall power), -b is battery power, -u is ups, and -a is all.  you can also edit the plist directly, but you have to restart to apply the changes:  sudo /usr/libexec/plistbuddy -c 'set "custom profile":"ac power":darkwakebackgroundtasks 1' \     /library/preferences/systemconfiguration/com.apple.powermanagement.plist   or using sed:  sudo sed -i '' '/darkwakebackgroundtasks/{n;s/false/true/;}' \     /library/preferences/systemconfiguration/com.apple.powermanagement.plist

normalising, as such, is not really helpful when importing from commercial recordings, as the mastering engineer will have already made sure the tracks are correctly normalised, whilst maintaining the relative levels between each component track.  the only way to truly level-match would be using compression &amp; limiting algorithms, which really ought to be left to a professional, &amp; is beyond the scope of ask different.  the way to do this at consumer-level is to use itunes for playback [&amp; also would be by far the simplest for the initial ripping, as it is capable of all your bullet points] &amp; switch on sound check in prefs > playback.  this allows itunes to measure the apparent loudness of each track or album &amp; automatically adjust the playback levels on the fly, enabling more comfortable listening without levels jumping around track to track.  this is done by a system known as replaygain see 'alternatives' at the end of that wiki page for a brief explanation of why normalisation &amp; recompression are not ideal solutions.  however, itunes has traditionally done this on a per-track basis, not a per-album basis, which can make quiet tracks in the middle of an otherwise loud album jump out at you far too much. this trait is reported to be fixed in recent versions, but once a track has been analysed, itunes will not go back &amp; fix it later.  to get around this, you may need to employ something like ivolume which is capable of resetting the itunes data, then recalibrating
as far as i know appletv has no capabilities for this
as soon as a new mac os is released, the previous one becomes unavailable.  the only way to get an older os directly from apple is to have previously 'purchased it' - even if it was free - then it will appear in your purchase history in the app store

i don't believe so
it looks like every app determines what to show on its notifications; i don't see a global switch.  you can, however, turn the lock screen notification off.  find it on settings > notifications > [app], look for "show on lock screen" and turn it off to disallow the app to show its notifications when the phone is locked.    skype does not have the "show previews" switch available at the notifications settings for messages –and i can't find anything about that subject on the support site, but plenty of people asking the same with no response– so it appears that each app controls what it's shown on the notification.   
i know this is a fringe case
there are three microphones on the iphone 5

i don't know if the built-in keyboard viewer is sophisticated enough, but it should highlight pressed keys.    if you do not see those options, make sure it is checked off under your system preferences > keyboard    there are also apps like keycastr that display bezel elements for pressed keys.

what does the terminal command file f0009024.apple show you about the files have.  it's highly unlikely they are truncated apple single or apple double files, but that's the only guess i have at the moment. 
under system preferences -&gt; security &amp; privacy there is an option to not require password to wake computer from sleep or screen saver.   
apple's memory upgrade page for your model imac calls for pc-10600 so-dimms. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4255  those corsair so-dimms meet all the stated specifications, even though some sites erroneously list them as pc-10666 (corsair lists them as pc-10600).  furthermore, if you look through the reviews on newegg and other sites for this memory, you can see reports of people using it successfully in their macs.  so i would conclude that yes, it's safe to use it in your 2010 imac. 
if you are on 10.7 and not 10.8, the solution below works well:  i had the same problem with eclipse, but now i've added e.g

i can't believe nobody has suggested the simplest method of all, only 2 clicks (or 3 if your adapter isn't at the top of the list).  click system preferences, click network.  it will display the ip address of the adapter under status to the right of the network adapters
you can find some information about the guts of an ipod shuffle here. also because the selling point of a shuffle is price (and portability) while still maintaining the apple quality i don't think apple would put much more components into it than what is absolutely necessary. 
just chmod -r ug+w project-dir (starting from the root of the project) 
by the general term "app", you ostensibly mean app store? and if you did delete his apple id, then it wouldn't ask for updates.  you can either use a third-party program to remove those apps, or first delete them from the applications directory, then from application support located at ~/library/application\ support/
adobe provides an online pdf creator which they state handles framemaker files.  however, it costs $10 a month to use it, but it might be worth a shot
you can do this individually by dragging the image(s) in, right clicking on them and clicking "view as icon"
you can put the new iphoto itself on a usb drive, and just replace the file in applications (after taking the necessary backup precautions, of course)
in iphoto, turn photo stream off then on.  go to preferences > photo stream
no - the power supply expects 100-240 vac and lists the current draw as 1.5 a which seems quite high for the heat it puts out, but perhaps with several usb drives connected and max power it gets even half that usage in real life.  you certainly can take dc power from poe using a splitter, but those all seem to provide 1a at 12 vdc which is a far cry short of the wattage listed for the airport extreme

wish i could claim credit for this one, but i found it buried in https://github.com/chcokr/osx-init/blob/master/install.sh  this worked on my 10.10 headless vm without a logged in ui.  touch /tmp/.com.apple.dt.commandlinetools.installondemand.in-progress; prod=$(softwareupdate -l |   grep "\*.*command line" |   head -n 1 | awk -f"*" '{print $2}' |   sed -e 's/^ *//' |   tr -d '\n') softwareupdate -i "$prod" -v;  
libraries are usually referenced using absolute paths on os x, making it unnecessary to set any variables
make a time machine backup from within the vm and use this to restore the native machine once you've re-installed os x there..  i do not know if all drivers are installed at all times (doesn't happen for windows) so i would be a bit wary of using cloned disks to do this
to erase everything and restore the iphone to the factory state, go into settings, then general, then reset
if you have a mac, connect your iphone to it.  there is a build in app (from apple) called image capture in your applications folder.  use it to bulk delete photos on iphone.

apple seem to have removed/hidden some of the more advanced options from the airport utility interface in version 6 and this is likely one of them
so, i got it to work in the end by:   using disk utility to burn installesd.dmg to a dvd, creating an install disc. booting the installer from that dvd. having the dvd installer immediately say "there was a problem" and i should "try reinstalling"; using the utilities menu to launch terminal, killing the installer app, which caused it to relaunch and give me an opportunity to reinstall
so i figured this out

something, somewhere, didn't register correctly.  possibly someone maybe able to figure out exactly which receipt or app store file to find, however, it would be far simpler &amp; possibly safer to just get the standalone os x yosemite 10.10.3 combo updater &amp; run it again; because you don't know what else didn't happen as planned either &amp; the combo will make sure everything since 10.10.0 is correctly updated.  you can use a download manager to fetch it, too &amp; it will then be resumable if the download halts for any reason. - examples at download manager for mac os x [though speed download, arguably the best, is discontinued.] 
in a situation where you're installing a package that supports relocation, it is possible to provide an installer choices xml file to installer to modify the installation options

i used the following a lot.  ⌘cmd+ꜛ: home  ⌘cmd+↓: end  ⌘cmd+←: beginning of line  ⌘cmd+→: end of line  these i learned the other day from here - very handy for coding and writing, these are emacs bindings which work on macs.  ctrl+a: beginning of line.  ctrl+e: end of line.  ctrl+u: delete from cursor to beginning of line.  ctrl+k: delete from cursor to end of line.  ctrl+w: erase word to the left.  ctrl+t: transpose characters around cursor. 
for some reason or another, apple has made it impossible to access junk messages from a smart mailbox.  if you are able to set message is in mailbox to junk, you must be setting it to a special 'junk' mailbox that you have created (or that was created automatically by whatever email service you connect to)

what i usually do in this situation is look up the album in the itunes store.   if it’s not available in the itunes store, i get the album art from some other source. if it is available in the itunes store but “get album art” doesn’t seem to do anything, there’s probably a mismatch in the meta data somewhere
no - apple tv (currently) engages hdcp only when needed to protect content that requires hdcp
yes, you can do some modifications &amp; scripting to get the effect.  see instructions here: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jrgxx/how_to_quarter_step_volume_adjustment_in_lion/ 
yes that script should run on os x
drag protocol can be a bit confusing, however, it does follow a recognisable pattern…  to the same volume     drag will move - unless the file is in a protected location [root level of the volume, or in a protected system folder], in which case it will copy    opt ⌥  drag will copy    cmd ⌘  drag will override the simple drag behaviour for protected files &amp; move instead [but will need admin authentication].   to a different volume     drag will copy    opt ⌥  drag will copy    cmd ⌘  drag will move [ie, copy, then delete the original.]   so,  opt ⌥  always copies, but  cmd ⌘  reverses the default behaviour of just dragging.  worst case scenario - you can change your modifier key &amp; check the added icon on the file you're dragging to see your end result, right up until you let go of the mouse button.  just to complete the set -  cmd ⌘   opt ⌥  dragging will make an alias at the destination.  edit …&amp; after all that i realise that preview will not adhere to that behaviour… move appears to not be an option at all. best guess is that you cannot move an open document &amp; even hope that an app could keep track of where it went. the finder can
avitools is trialware, but all it does is nag you and limit you to one job at a time.  mpeg streamclip is another free mac app that, despite the name, can mux together avi, mpeg, mkv, and other sorts of video files into one big file.  and there's always good old ffmpeg, but it isn't quite as user-friendly as the above. 
some tool like remote buddy might help here, but it's probably much more than you asked for. 
the system_profiler command is perhaps the best tool for the job (assuming you are on 10.3 or newer), but you can also use ioreg for the task.  system_profiler sphardwaredatatype is the data type that contains the core hardware information, and you can use grep or awk to pare things down further as needed:  system_profiler sphardwaredatatype | awk '/serial/ {print $4}'   or  ioreg -l | awk '/ioplatformserialnumber/ { print $4;}'   both of those commands take between 0.5 and 0.2 seconds to run on modern ssd macs, so if you want to optimize the command and remove the " you can have your answer in 0.005s or so:  ioreg -c ioplatformexpertdevice -d 2 | awk -f\" '/ioplatformserialnumber/{print $(nf-1)}'  
i finally managed it by re-creating my itunes library as mentioned here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1451.  after moving the .itl file i also moved the books folder under itunes music.  it takes quite some time to import, depending on the size of the library, and it will finally warn that some items could not be found - which is obvious after deleting books.  after that the contents of ibooks appeared in the books sync tab.  edit: unfortunately, all my apps for my i-devices were gone, too
i heard that it was the day eniac was revealed to the world:     the completed machine was announced to the public the evening of february 14, 1946 and formally dedicated the next day at the university of pennsylvania   the theory being that there were no "files" in existence prior to that date.  with regard to the time, 0x4f3afdb0 (from finder.h above) mod 86400 (seconds in a day) is 2096

i am unsure if you are asking how to exclude folders from showing up in your finder spotlight search, or if what you are after is to hide specific folders from being shown in a finder window.  if you are after excluding folders from a spotlight search, you can do this in the privacy tab from system preferences / spotlight :    if you are after having the ability to show or hide files and folders from being viewed while you are in a finder window, then you can create an automator service to do just that :  hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100719001040829  note : the tip above only toggles all files that have the hidden flag set, so if you need to quickly mark a folder or a file as "hidden", then you need to set this bit attribute for that file or folder.  an easy way to do this is via a free utility software download that does just this here (used to be shareware, but now free ) : gotoes.org/showhiddenfilesmacosx/  note 2 :  if you are happy using the terminal command line, you can just type the following on the terminal :  chflags hidden (drag your file or folder onto the terminal window here)   or  chflags nohidden (drag your file or folder here)   hope this helps
no, there's no way to see which words you have looked up previously in the dictionary using the "define" shortcut in various apps. 
here is a fantastic article on moving to icloud
i looked at some of the saved search files in finder's application bundle, and for example /system/library/coreservices/finder.app/contents/resources/mylibraries/mydocuments.cannedsearch/search.savedsearch used a format like this for excluding directories:  &lt;key&gt;fxscopearrayofpaths&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;   &lt;string&gt;~/&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-library&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-music/itunes&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-documents/steam content&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;~/library/mobile documents/&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-com~apple~keynote&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-com~apple~pages&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-com~apple~numbers&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt;   so you can exclude subfolders by adding strings that start with a minus character after a full path

i am not aware of any ios or web app that will allow bulk deletion of icloud reminders but that is something that presumably could be written.  the only mechanism i am aware of that will bulk delete reminders is the automator app running on os x.  here is a screen shot of something that would find all reminders older than 20 days and delete them summarily.    you can see i searched for reminder and chose a task to select them and another to delete them

logind is a normal part of os x
i didn't think of posting this question until today but after a few weeks of experimentation, i've determined that, for some strange reason, ipod shuffle will only update play metadata when, before my next sync, i either   finish listening to a playlist, or switch from one playlist to another.   if i don't finish listening to a playlist (which can be the case with very large playlists), the metadata will not be updated on itunes.  powering ipod shuffle off and on between listens does not appear to make a difference, but i'll report back with any new findings
this is actually an os x issue and not a pages issue since pages uses the system dictionaries.  you can use this support article to find the answer:   http://help.apple.com/pages/mac/5.2/#/tanf3d8c3e49   you will see that romanian spelling dictionary isn't something that ships with 10.11 - but you can add custom dictionaries under the spell check multiple language section at the bottom of the page.   open system preferences on your mac, click keyboard, then click text

this can happen with any file type, not just podcasts, and i've suffered from this a few times when i move my itunes library about, especially with tv shows.  the only solution i found was to move the episodes out of the itunes media folder, then use the add to library in itunes to add them back in

on mac os x snow leopard (and maybe leopard), the spell checker is smart enough to detect which language you're using.  well, ymmv, personally i'm mostly writing in french and english, and i just have to type the 4 ou 5 first word, and mac os x automatically detect which language i'm using.  it seems to detect at least by paragraph, but it could also be by sentence, i haven't fully tested.  so try to set your spell checker language to "detect automatically" and see if it's smart enough for your use. 
there is no hardware virtualization to turn on or off like on wintel pcs.  that switch and many other bios switches are there because (at least in part) the hardware manufacturers don't make the hardware and software, like apple does.  it is always on in any mac that has a processor that supports virtualization

"~/library" is the short path for "/users/username/library" where "username" is the name of the user.  "/users/username/library" is the short path for "/volumes/volumename/users/username/library" where "volumename" is the name of the volume.  "/volumes/volumename/users/username/library" is the full path of a user library.  if you want to access a user library from a different volume than the start / boot volume, then you must use the full path.  select "go to folder" in the "go" menu of the finder, enter the full path and confirm.  please note that you might get a permission error if you (aka the current user) do not have access to this folder. 
as time goes by, you make various edits to a given file, and time machine will make progressive backups of that file

if anyone else tried bmike's method but didn't fix multiple logins, try the following :   system preferences security and privacy unlock the settings using the lock button (buttom left) advanced disable "log out after ## minutes of inactivity" option   now you should only get one login screen after a screen saver or waking up, rather than logging you out and having to enter the password twice.  what i deduced from this is that it logs you out, and you have to enter the password to log in again

never mind! i found the answer here:  super user: show/hide extension of a file through os x command line  i will delete this question now!  edit -   since some are upvoting this question, i will echo the top answer in the linked question (supplied by @slhck).  a straightforward solution exists, because applescript specifically offers a set extension hidden command designed to do exactly what i'm looking for.  tell application "finder"     set some_file to (choose file)     set extension hidden of some_file to false end tell   and that will make the file extension visible! 
they both output a similar voltage level ~5v
all you need is to open terminal.app and type:  sudo shutdown now   that way the system will be forced to terminate all open programs, ignoring any unsaved file changes.  so, in order to be able to launch it via the desktop, you need to open applescript editor, and type:  do shell script "shutdown now" with administrator privileges   save the script as an application, and drag it in your dock, or somewhere where you'll find it instantly. 
it's possible that, for some reason, push can't go through

dropdmg  i use and recommend dropdmg since it has many features that make it useful for sharing software such as scripting the building of a dmg file directly from my ci server when i promote a build using the included cli tool dropdmg.    above: many options for configuring a dmg file, including layouts and showing a license when opening the dmg. 
if you're using lion, you can use smbutil:  usage: smbutil [-hv] subcommand [args] where subcommands are:  help       display help on specified subcommand  lookup     resolve netbios name to ip address  status     resolve ip address or dns name to netbios names  view       list resources on specified host  dfs        list dfs referrals  identity   identity of the user as known by the specified host   for example (assuming 192.168.1.9 is a valid ip on your network):  smbutil lookup 192.168.1.9 smbutil status bill-pc   if you're using snow leopard, you should be able to use nmblookup:  nmblookup -a 192.168.1.9 nmblookup bill-pc  
you are probably dealing with an autorecover issue
unless you excluded the os files from the backup, time machine should've backed that up along with everything else; but in order to recover the entire os (rather than just your user files), you have to do the restore differently: use the restore tool in recovery mode (reachable by starting the mac with command and r held down)
ssh can get confused if your short name is different between the two machines

ok everyone! i've finally got around to fixing my mac! for future reference, here is how i did it!  firstly, i redownloaded the mountain lion installer from the app store (as it is a digital download now) by holding option and clicking 'purchases' to make it appear (after reading a forum online).  after doing this, i created a new blank partition on my spare drive ready to create my own bootable mac os mountain lion installer.  next, i downloaded a free app called 'lion diskmaker 2' (http://liondiskmaker.com) which took my installer and create a bootable drive out of it using my blank partition.  after that i created a time machine backup.  then i booted into my new mountain lion installer and completely reformatted my macintosh hd back into the 1 partition format.  then i installed mountain lion onto that using my time machine backup.  and here i am back with the 1 partition and now using the entire drive! lengthy process but got there in the end!  so if anyone else has got this problem, this is how to fix it! :)  thanks for all of your help anyway! 
to make the keyboard behave differently, you need a different keyboard layout.  you could create one by editing an xlm file manually, or you could use a third-party tool to create the keyboard layout (you don't need to be running a third-party program indefinitely once they layout is created and installed).  ukelele is known for making it fairly easy to create new keyboard layouts for the mac.  in any event, you want to switch the number keys (0-9) and the symbols attached to them
a new ipad version of chrome has this feature where you can type chrome://history into the search field / address bar to retrieve history.  currently the ios version of google chrome is 28.0.1500.16 so presumably older versions of the app do not have any way to get history, but newer versions do.

i looked into it and here is what i found. in lion the swipe to navigate is grouped in system preference > trackpad > more gestures under the "swipe between pages" option. under that option, you get a) scroll left or right with two fingers b) swipe left or right with three fingers c) swipe with two or three fingers  option a is the new navigation method featured in the new safari during the wwdc keynote

based on this question  note: i am assuming you are in recovery already.  commands are like this.   open terminal from the menu bar (under utilities) change directory: cd /volumes list all volumes: ls change to the volume you want to access

a user name alias functions as a simple way to create a shorthand version of an account name
usually this is a problem with spotlight.  the simplest step is to shut down the mac, disconnect all external drives, and start up to make sure no extra volumes are mounted
the short answer is no.  the reasons are numerous, but the first is that anything compiled to run on a device can not be run in the simulator because the processor architecture is different
in a terminal, use the following command:  mdfind "kmditemkind == '*movie'"   this will output the fully qualified pathnames of files in which the metadata stores used by spotlight classify it as some type of movie.  example output from a movie taken on my iphone and transferred to iphotos on my mac, one of the lines outputted by mdls is:  kmditemkind                    = "quicktime movie"  "quicktime movie", which have a .mov extension was just one of extension types that showed as "$some_type_of movie"
there are two ways to send content via airplay from your mac to your apple tv when it comes out of the box
if you go to itunes and select your device there is a tab called "photos"  if you check and uncheck the boxes as shown:    check "sync photos"  chose "selected albums, events..." radio button un-check "last 12 months" and "last import" and any you don't want then check any albums you do want   you should be set. 
you've managed to enable voiceover! if your sound had been turned on, you'd also hear your computer speaking the words that appear on screen
just find the track [or the entire album] in itunes, select it then hit  cmd ⌘   i  to get info. select the artwork tab then drag your picture from finder into there.  unfortunately, this appears to work for just about any format except wav. this also applies to an overall 'album' artwork added to the folder rather than files
assuming mountain lion 10.8.2:   click on the photo in contacts click once to select the one you want from the resulting grid of available photos click on the icon with the pencil across it at the bottom left of the grid window. click on the larger version of the image that appears, and copy the image to the clipboard.   assuming mountain lion 10.8.4:   click on the photo in contacts make sure the image opens in the large pop-up underneath the small image. click on the larger image. copy the image to the clipboard, e.g

camera sensors are not only limited in their resolution, but also in the rate at which the image data can be read off of them.  just because a sensor can take 5-megapixel still images doesn't mean that all of that data can be read off the sensor fast enough to record (smooth) video
i’m assuming by “end with” you mean that files have the extension .jar or .doc

the ipod nano and classic ipods get loaded a custom firmware that could be downloaded from the internet and possibly loaded with a tool other than itunes, but on a pc you could easily use whatever disk tool you want to erase the drive by reformatting it.  since this would render the device unbootable, you will not want to sell it to a user that's not familiar with why it's not working, so the elegant solution would be to rent another computer with itunes and restore it.  apple's retail stores usually will even loan you a cable to restore your device from any of the display macs

to do this for just emacs, use  alias emacs=/usr/local/bin/emacs   in your shell startup file which will make emacs always run homebrew emacs instead of whatever is first in your $path.  but the better way to do this is to make your shell always look for homebrew versions of commands first, by putting /usr/local/bin first, or at least early, in your $path.  so if your $path is set like this:  export path="$path:/usr/local/bin"   change it to this:  export path="/usr/local/bin:$path"   /usr/local/bin is a directory containing symlinks to all homebrew-installed commands, emacs included, and your shell starts at the beginning of the $path to figure out what executable to use, so putting it first will in effect choose the homebrew emacs first.  one last thing - please remove /usr/local/cellar/emacs/24.4/bin from your $path

assuming this works the same as on my iphone 3gs, you´ll want to go into the photo roll (not show an actual photo) and then tap the "share" button in the upper right corner (the one that looks like an arrow pointing out of a square) - you will then be able to select up to five images and tap on "send" to send them as an e-mail.

one of the best applications is marsedit (40$) by red sweater software. it supports many blog types (including tumblr), and allows both html and rich text editing. i think it also allows editing wordpress pages and not only blog posts. it handles image uploading, editing of posts and supports multiple blogs.  some of the cons of marsedit are its html editing shortcuts and macros which are a little uncomfortable and a bit too little.  if you're comfortable with html, then the known textmate text editor can also be used as an editor for blog posts and then you can either copy/paste from there or use a blogging bundle which will let you upload from there

xcode does support tabs
if the file was installed by homebrew, it is a symlink to a file in /usr/local/cellar/:  $ ls -l /usr/local/share/info/bash.info lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  wheel  45 mar 15 15:25 /usr/local/share/info/bash.info -&gt; ../../cellar/bash/4.2.45/share/info/bash.info   it's also possible that the file was not installed by homebrew
try using open instead of launching the program directly
aliases are not the same as symlinks.  symlinks just point to a path (relative or absolute). aliases first track the file's unique id and then the path.  since there are two pieces of information stored in an alias - they are more robust and will follow a file that's moved based on the unique id.  finder (or the very powerful ditto) are your best bets for moving aliases intact
once you've completed the registration, all the information you've filled up, will be sent to apple with your idevice / computer's serial number

the easiest (and free) way would be to upgrade your system to osx 10.9 (mavericks); they actually built this into the newest version of safari which is included.  if you don't want to venture down that route, there are a few safari extensions you can use to accomplish your goal.   clicktoplugin and/or clicktoflash http://hoyois.github.io/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/ youtube5 extension - blocks them by not supporting them http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/   3: adblock plus - follow the development builds page (the 2nd link) to see when they release their version for safari - i know it's delayed right now but still in development, you'll need to google this as i don't have enough rep to post more than 2 links, sorry.  personally i run mavericks, but also use clicktoplugin; it works for any ads that the newest version of safari doesn't catch. 
system preferences: keyboard: modifier keys...   then swap the command and control keys
aliases are used as a shortcuts - sipmple commands that expand to longer ones. if you need to pass an argument to it, you would need to create a function. maybe try something like:  reminder () { automator -i $1 add_reminder.workflow' }   here $1 will expand to the first argument that you've passed to the function. so you'll to do something like:  reminder "buy potatoes"   p.s: i haven't tried it, since i don't have zsh with me right now, so if it breaks, give me a shout.

the recovery partition on your original disk was the only supported method until the recovery disk assistant was made available.    the bulk of this answer was written before the official steps were published - so i would recommend the recovery disk assistant even though ht4718 steps help understand what is happening under the hood.  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4718  the easiest is to get a drive enclosure or adapter and re-run the lion installer from the recovery hd and install lion onto the new ssd.  it likely won't matter if the drive with the recovery hd is on an external bus or an internal bus, but i would keep the original drive inside the mac until you have lion installed on your ssd connected to an external port.  boot off the ssd to test it and run migration from the internal drive to the ssd before doing swapping the drives inside your mac.  it still boggles my mind that any mac will ship without some sort of reinstall media

lion installs a recovery disk by default on your computer, so you can troubleshoot and re-install the os without having to download it again.  simply start your computer while pressing command+r
since /usr/libexec/plistbuddy ships with os x and doesn't need any developer tools or third party installation, you should assume that tool is ubiquitous and develop against that if at all possible.  i actually prefer plutil to convert things to xml or json and then use a script to make whatever changes are necessary, but your options are not bad ones to use either. 
you need a product like this:  kvm console to usb 2.0 portable laptop crash cart adapter  however i don't know if that will show up as a streamable device (or if it's even compatible with mac)

you are correct that the recovery partition is not on your machine.  on my lion machine i see:  $ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       type name                    size       identifier    0:      guid_partition_scheme                        *500.1 gb   disk0    1:                        efi                         209.7 mb   disk0s1    2:                  apple_hfs macintosh hd            499.1 gb   disk0s2    3:                 apple_boot recovery hd             650.0 mb   disk0s3   you could clone your existing drive "crucial m4 ssd" to an external disk, then repartition and reinstall lion, then clone it back, though reinstalling lion over your existing volume may also work! you could also try downloading the recovery update and see if that can add it:  http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1464 
you certainly don't need to reinstall - just remove the offending last line of the file and restart terminal to see the effects.  if you don't know how to edit the file from terminal, you can open the file in your system's default plain text editor:  /usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile   just delete the last line and save the file
there is not really a setting with in xcode 4 to configure external editors as there use to be in xcode 3
in general, anything visibly stored inside your own user directory is fair game to delete if you no longer want it.  i say visibly because the library folder in your user directory has some file that are safe to delete and others that may have unintended, nasty consequences.  finally, some applications and applications bundles do contain stuff that you could delete safely, but, like the library folder, it may be best to leave alone just in case.  btw, unlike the suggestion below, i'd avoid using the rm command unless you know exactly what you are doing
the file that is executed when you run the command xattr is /usr/bin/xattr which is a python script that works out what version of python you have and then executes /usr/bin/xattr-2.7 for python 2.7

you cannot change the underlying routing service with the default maps app for driving instructions, but what you can do is choose 3rd party applications for certain routing routing options, namely cycle routes, public transport options etc that are not provided by default within the app directly (since the switch to apple's own mapping service).  following the steps from this knowledge base article, the workflow seems to be      transit      maps in ios allows you to choose your own third-party app from the app   store to provide transit information

sounds like you have postfix installed and running.  you should check your postfix configuration.  there is a good description here.  or do it your self: if postfix is still not working, check the log file in /var/log/mail.log for the error:      sendmail: fatal: chdir /library/server/mail/data/spool: no such file   or directory   to fix this, run the following commands in terminal:  sudo mkdir -p /library/server/mail/data/spool sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions sudo /usr/sbin/postfix start   if as you say you do not want it to be on your computer then disable it.  sudo /bin/launchctl unload -w /system/library/launchdaemons/org.postfix.master.plist   that does not answer your question who is using it, but without more info from you one can not say, it could be a script in your system.  you could try to find out who is sending by going to   open your console:  scroll down to var/log/mail.log     the background: mac osx comes with the postfix mta, which is a fully   featured smtp server

according to this article (sorry, german only) the iphone - attached to a wall charger - detects that no data sync is possible and charges with the full specified power (±1000 ma).  attached to an usb 2 interface (like your mac) the power is reduced to ±500 ma to not interfere with the data stream.  now the smart pcbs in usb cables as "sonicable" and "doubletime" come in: attached to an usb interface they trick the charging controller by simulating a wall charger on the data lines and the charging power is then increased to > 500 ma again if the interface can deliver that

you may need two approaches:    one to switch the version for the applet plug-in alone another approach to switch the version for other parts of the jre without switching the version for the applet plug-in.   my recent use case:    java 8 for apps that do not use the plug-in java 7 update 9 for the applet plug-in.     to switch the applet plug-in but not other parts of the jre/jdk from java 8 to java 7 update 9   quit web browsers and any other apps that use java or the java applet plug-in install jdk 8 set aside the plug-in install jre 7 update 9 or jdk 7 update 09.   setting aside: suggested move  sudo mv /library/internet\ plug-ins/javaappletplugin.plugin /private/var/tmp   if you plan to switch frequently, you may prefer a different temporary location

while the dock doesn't have the concept of "folders" for the apps that are pinned to or running in it, as of mac os x 10.5 leopard the stacks feature can provide something similar.  dragging the applications folder from the finder into the "stacks section" (right of the white-dashed line) of the dock will add it as a stack
yes, you can
   is there a way to see or edit the locations associated with icloud reminders within ical?   in a word, "no".  even in mountain lion developer preview with access to a standalone reminders app (reminders, or "todos" were removed from ical - hooray!) there is no ability to see these from os x

the fastest way using spotlight is to add kind:folder to the search term in the spotlight field.    you can use booleans, metadata tags like kind:music or date:yesterday and more as described in specifying criteria in the spotlight search field  i always forget about these and instead use the search window to build up a boolean criteria rather than use the default spotlight menu search (where all the other data detectors compete to provide you relevant matches)  instead of command+space try option+command+space  then click the circle + on the right by save and override the "any" with "folder"    i don't know a way to automate or save this further as the default, but it's a way that will work on all macs.

the other world computing blog shows that the new macbook pro 15" with retina display can run 3 external displays:       image source: http://blog.macsales.com/   these resolutions were used:   retina on laptop @ “best for retina” imac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via thunderbolt imac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via thunderbolt/displayport lg monitor @ 1920 x 1200  via hdmi   quote from the macrumors news article on that:     this makes the retina macbook pro the first mac -- other than a tower-based workstation like the mac pro -- to natively power four displays simultaneously.  
according to apple's specs listed under tech specs for the mac pro it should be able to handle 3 displays at up to 2560 by 1600 pixels over the digital connections

you are probably victim of an adware: osx/pirrit
according to apple's documentation:     if your mac has a boot camp partition with windows xp or windows   vista, you can continue to use your boot camp partition, but you can’t   upgrade to boot camp 4.0.   so it sounds like if you upgrade to mountain lion, it won't touch your boot camp 3.x installation; you won't get boot camp 4.0, but you'll be able to continue using xp.  however, i think if you do a clean install of mountain lion, that will install boot camp 4.0 by default, which requires windows 7
you can sign up for the public beta (available in july) of ios 9 and osx el capitan at:  apple public beta signup  in the past, the public beta has delays release of a specific build a bit behind the developer betas so those builds won't be as potentially buggy or as up to date.  the new unified developer account costs $99 yearly

you may wish to avoid using ibooks author (iba) and the itunes store for distribution since what you seek to do (provide a free download to paying customers that pay elsewhere) violates apple's guidelines that each sku either be paid (and paid through an appleid and apple's payment system) or free to all who wish to download it.   http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5071   there is nothing preventing you from controlling the distribution of a generic  source file that's pdf or epub format and using whatever payment system you want
system prefs > mission control uncheck automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use.    this will fix the order of all your regular spaces - but not fullscreen spaces, which always seem to go to the right of existing spaces.

a recipe for deploying ilife 11 using deploystudio just rolled across my twitter stream, so almost all the credit here goes to steve yuroff for the recipe.  it is available on github and lists the package names and checksums for verifying the install.   https://github.com/swy/ilife-11-instadmg-catalog/blob/master/ilife11.catalog  
to check for it manually, go to settings -> general -> software update.  your device will then check with apple's servers and let you update if there is newer software available, otherwise it will show you the current version and tell you that you're already up to date.

the built in “erase all content and settings” function (found in the settings app, under general → reset) should be sufficient in virtually all cases.  the 3gs and later iphones, 3rd generation and later ipod touches and all ipads use hardware encryption, where all data is stored encrypted in their flash memory
this site has a way to translate into a mac network location and open it: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040322155331393  so you could easily save that as a text service and be able to select a windows network location, right-click it, and have it translated and opened.  i imagine you could sort of reverse the function and translate back into a windows network location string.  here's how to set up a text service to convert to a mac path and open it in finder:   open up automator choose "service" drag a "run applescript" item from the library into the main area on the right. copy and paste this applescript into it: https://gist.github.com/2211017 (it wouldn't properly format in here) save it under "convert and open windows path" or whatever you like. select a path in an application, right-click it, and look for the service you created (it might be under a "services" sub-menu)   here's what your automator service should look like:

you can disable gatekeeper in system preferences:    this removes the warnings about opening files downloaded from the internet:  defaults write com.apple.launchservices lsquarantine -bool false   it doesn't affect the dialogs about opening applications for the first time though.  you can run finder as root with osascript -e 'quit app "finder"' &amp;&amp; sudo /system/library/coreservices/finder.app/contents/macos/finder, but it's not really meant to be done permanently.

the answer to the question you posted:     when a client connects, from which range does the server take the ip?   do clients get ips from random ranges, or is there some priority?   excluding any existing leases that the client may re-request or any statically assigned addresses, your dhcp server will exhaust all 189 addresses in the first pool before it goes into the second pool.  what you need to do to make this work is have:   os x dhcp server listening on 2 separate network adapters (you can use one physical one and use vlans)

although quality will be lost when converting the bit rate to 128kbps, one option is to use a combination of a smart playlist in itunes and max.  1) either back up music library or specify a different output directory in max, and then re-import files to itunes.  2) in itunes, create a smart playlist where the bit rate is greater than 128 kbps for example.  3) select the files from the playlist and drag them to the conversion window in max

you can pass administrator privileges to a line of applescript which requires administrator privileges by appending "with administrator privileges":  do shell script "security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustroot -k /library/keychains/system.keychain ~/desktop/mywificertificate.crt" with administrator privileges  
if you have an icloud account, you can enable photo stream and sync it to your mac or pc, then delete them on ipad, and you can upgrade.  btw ios 7.0.2 to 7.0.3 ota only takes less than 1gb of space, so you can just delete some music or apps you don't want. 
data containing a file's original location before being placed in the trash is keep in the .ds_store file in the ~/.trash folder.  since the trash folder is hidden it can not normally be found using the finder application

i got this exact same problem
1 quick answer  enter this command in terminal:  cp -r -n ./srcfolder/ ./targetfolder/  remove the -n if you want to overwrite duplicates.  update: ditto source target will also do the trick.  files in source folder overwrite any duplicates in target folder.  add -v for details (ditto -v source target)  via how to merge folders on mac os x without losing all your files (seriously)  2 use finder (surprisingly more complex)  possibly a duplicate of where did folder &quot;merge&quot; or &quot;keep both&quot; go in os x 10.9 mavericks?, but i'll sum up:  the weird thing is, the folders can't have any duplicate files if you want to merge.  if you're merging two folders that don't have any duplicate files between them, you will see the merge option if you hold the option key.   however, if the folders you're merging contain any files with the same name, the merge option won't show up.   in that case, you basically have two options:   use the command line or manually remove duplicates, then click &amp; drag + hold option to merge.  
/usr/local has been both re-creatable and writable on el capitan since 2015-10-21 when apple released /system/library/sandbox/compatibility.bundle version 12 in software update 031-40358 patching 10.11 and 10.11.1, and installed as part of the 10.11.2 update, 10.11.2 combo update, and 10.11.2 clean installs

there is a bash/terminal/command line command that might help to import dns zone data into mac os x lion its dns server.  $ sudo serveradmin settings dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:allowzonetransfer = yes   issuing this command creates a zone file (in this example for "domain.tld") with some default settings and without any host records.  $ sudo serveradmin settings dns | grep dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:allowzonetransfer = yes dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:aliases = _empty_array dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:expire = 604800 dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:serial = 2013122701 dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:allow-update = no dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:adminemail = "admin@domain.tld" dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:machines = _empty_array dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:nameservers = _empty_array dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:refresh = 86400 dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:mailexchangers = _empty_array dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:reversemappings = _empty_array dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:retry = 3600 dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:timetolive = 345600 dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:servicerecords = _empty_array dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:bonjourregistration = no dns:views:_array_id:com.apple.serveradmin.dns.public:primaryzones:_array_id:domain.tld:name = "domain.tld"   the created zone file with default settings now looks like:  $ cat /private/var/named/db.domain.tld domain.tld

as an alternative solution for sublime text (if you want to keep the new os key mappings) you can add the following lines to your user key bindings file (in menu subline text 2 > preferences > key bindings - user):  { "keys": ["super+shift+up"], "command": "swap_line_up" }, { "keys": ["super+shift+down"], "command": "swap_line_down" }   this will map &#8984;+shift+↑ or ↓ to the swap line up/down commands.  a similar issue exists with the batch selection commands usually mapped to ctrl+shift+↑ or ↓.  these can be remapped using the following settings:  { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+shift+up"], "command": "select_lines", "args": {"forward": false} }, { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+shift+down"], "command": "select_lines", "args": {"forward": true} }    this will map ctrl+alt+shift+↑ or ↓ to the batch selection commands.  obviously you can change the combinations to whatever you prefer, but these did not seem to be used for anything.

many full screen writing applications like writeroom and byword either add a margin to the bottom or support centering the view around the current line.  you could also create ~/library/keybindings/ and save a property list like this as defaultkeybinding.dict:  {     "~p" = (movetoendofdocument:, insertnewlineignoringfieldeditor:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, insertnewline:, movewordbackward:, movetoendofparagraph:, moveforward:, centerselectioninvisiblearea);     "~r" = (movetoendofdocument:, movewordbackward:, movetoendofparagraph:, movetoendofdocumentandmodifyselection:, deletebackward:, centerselectioninvisiblearea:, insertnewlineignoringfieldeditor:); }   after reopening textedit, ⌥p should add padding lines to the end and ⌥r remove them.

i wouldn't advise aliasing rm to mv as you might get in the habit of rm not permanently deleting files and then run into issues on other computers or under other user accounts when it does permanently delete.  i wrote a set of bash scripts that add more mac os x-like command line tools (in addition to a number of the built-in ones like open, pbcopy, pbpaste, etc.), most importantly trash

you don't mention under which context you are mounting the disk, but what about going the other way and mounting the disk with the applescript?   i mention context because when mounting a disk with applescript is the big caveat that if it is a network volume, and the network is password-protected, then the user name and password would have to be stored as plain text in the script for a seamless execution.  update: a bit of searching found a similar question elsewhere. essentially, a script can be made to do this by applying the script as a folder action to /volumes:   on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items     repeat with aitem in these_items         tell application "finder"             if (local volume of aitem) and (name of aitem is "[name of hard drive]") then                 -- do something with the drive                 -- eject aitem             end if         end tell     end repeat end adding folder items to

there's a way to do this if you're jailbroken with tweak called activator by ryan petrich, and unfortunately it's the only solution because regular app store apps aren't allowed to access settings like bluetooth, wi-fi, and personal hotspot (even workflow cannot access them).  to jailbreak, you have to be on ios 9.1 or lower.  if you happen to be jailbroken, the way to do this with activator is to go settings &gt; bluetooth &gt; on then settings &gt; activator &gt; anywhere &gt; bluetooth devices &gt; connected to [your bluetooth device] and assign it to switches &gt; hotspot

i'm guessing that this application is used to retrieve facebook and twitter contact details for display in the address book.  this assumption is based on release notes for a recent update of mac os x, as well as the content of that application's executable (as viewed with strings):  strings /system/library/coreservices/addressbookurlforwarder.app/contents/macos/addressbookurlforwarder`).   the output of strings makes me think that the application is a url handler for these expressions:  ... _urlpatterns http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=$1 fb://profile/(.*) http://twitter.com/$1 twitter:///user[?]screen_name=(.+) http://twitter.com/share?text=$1 twitter:///post[?]message=(.+) ...   do you have a facebook account setup in system preferences -> mail, contacts &amp; calendars?

i have seen this happen when there is already a volume with the given name and the os needs to create a new name to mount the volume as you can't have a duplicate name -- thus the suffix.  the first thing to do is, make sure that you don't have any other volumes with the same name

it's a three step process - with pictures below!   click support in the quick links tab on the right hand side of the app store app. click billing in the web page that opened as a result of step 1. feed in all the information and wait the 24 hours or so it takes to get an initial response.   it is so worth it to ask for a refund or help (especially in your case where you didn't intend to buy yet) - everyone wins in the end as developers and apple really don't want a sale that ends up with an unsatisfied customer

i assume you are aware of the shareware tools (like the five mentioned in this article).  in any case, since you want the free option, you will have to rely in your common sense and the tools you have (this is also true for the shareware options, which really don’t seem to add much at this stage)

you can easily create a bootable usb drive as long as it's at least 1gb by using apple's recovery disk assistant
here are the 32 bit and 64 bit iso files that you would download for windows 7 since microsoft only supports digital downloads of windows 8. you could also look at this windows 7 forum for more download links.  you would use disk utility to restore the iso file to a usb flash drive (4 gb) (see picture below, but ignore the error :) )   in boot camp assistant, you would then select this iso file in the usb flash drive, assign how much space you would like, and it should complete it for you. 
i did the following to check/solve this (but i don't really know if i understand the question/the problem correctly):     create a file.bundle with  touch /users/user/temp/step1/file.bundle  create a symlink in another folder  ln -s /users/user/temp/step1/file.bundle /users/user/temp/step2/     the (re-transcribed) hex content of the symlink is:  /users/user/temp/step1/file.bundle   zip the symlink  zip -y /users/user/temp/step3file.bundle.zip /users/user/temp/step2/file.bundle`  create a folder (step4), cd into it and unzip step3file.bundle.zip   mkdir /users/user/temp/step4 cd /users/user/temp/step4 unzip /users/user/temp/step3file.bundle.zip     the (re-transcribed) hex content of the unzipped symlink in /users/user/temp/step4/users/user/temp/step2 is still:  /users/user/temp/step1/file.bundle   copy file.bundle in folder step1 using the symlink in a subfolder of folder step4 into folder step5  cd /users/user/temp/step4/users/user/temp/step2 cp file.bundle /users/user/temp/step5    the above steps work
yes, the best way to sync cross platform is via google.  by far the easiest most care free way to sync all contacts, calendars, email etc is to have all apple devices, this is how apple meant for this service to be used.  google has done a good job of making this service available to people working on multiple platforms.

apple is using core location code that's mostly common to ios and os x and the primary signal your mac has to determine location is detected wireless hotspot serial numbers (ssid and mac address if available).  also, by tracing the ip address for macs with active connections to the internet, often that will at least get you in the proper time zone and occasionally in the proper zip code (or postal code for people outside the us). 
there is no limit to how many ios devices you can sync with itunes
open keychain access and delete the digicert certificates, but only the ones in the login keychain - not the ones in system or system roots.  afterward, you may need to restart your browser and/or network service (switch airport off and on again, or disable and re-enable ethernet

isn't it the advanced log out feature found under advanced in security &amp; privacy?  i've disabled "log out after # minutes of activity" on el capitan (see screenshot) to keep my desktop session open regardless of time.  i did check the "require an administrator password" to prevent normal users to change a locked system.    you might also want to check your energy saver settings; particularly under the schedule..
i myself always used textedit for this job, open textedit and save blank page with desire extension in desire location.  also you can use nufile (i didn't test myself)    or use some applescript. 
perhaps try adding/appending them to /etc/resolv.conf? you cannot add them to the end of the list manually, delimiting with a comma in lion? it seems to work in 10.6, it adds it in addition to the dhcp supplied ones, and the entire lot of them show up in resolv.conf instantly

it sounds like you're using gmail, in which case, have you checked the all mail folder? gmail treats things a little differently, and i believe the default action for "delete" when using mail.app with gmail is actually what google calls "archive".  it doesn't delete it from the server, it just removes it from all folders (labels in gmail-speak), but the message still lives in the all mail folder.check there for your messages, and you may find this previous answer helpful: set up gmail to work properly with apple mail  if you're not using gmail, or that didn't work, try this:   in mail, open the preferences (⌘ command-,) in the preferences window, click the accounts panel and select the applicable account in the sidebar as shown here:  select the mailbox behaviours tab make sure the move deleted messages to the trash mailbox setting is checked:    if it's already checked, make sure your trash is set up properly, by selecting the mailbox you want in the main sidebar, then goto the mailbox menu, and choose use this mailbox for ‣ trash.   that should fix it

add an explicit get to resolve the reference to the tracks:  tell application "itunes"     repeat with t in (get tracks of playlist "listen smart" where shufflable is false)         set shufflable of t to true     end repeat     repeat with t in (get tracks of playlist "listen smart" where bookmarkable is false)         set bookmarkable of t to true     end repeat end tell   try running a script like this:  tell application "itunes"     repeat with t in (tracks of playlist "listen smart" where shufflable is false)         t     end repeat end tell   if the playlist has three tracks where shufflable is false, the result at the end will be something like item 3 of every track of playlist "listen smart" of application "itunes" whose shufflable = false
you'll need to tell bash where to keep your history file, and how many lines to keep:  # set the location of your histfile echo "export histfile=/users/&lt;username&gt;/.bash_history" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # number of lines to keep (1000 in this example) echo "export histfilesize=1000" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # set how many commands to keep in the current session history list echo "export histsize=80" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # ignore commands that start with a space echo "export histignore=\"&amp;:[ ]*:exit\"" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile

boot camp assistant.app - among other apps in the utilities folder - is protected by system integrity protection as outlined here.  by disabling sip you will be able to edit the info.plist again.  so boot to recovery mode by pressing cmdr while booting.   open terminal.app (menubar -> utilites -> terminal) enter csrutil disable reboot your mac  edit the file /applications/utilities/boot camp assistant.app/contents/info.plist reboot again to recovery mode and enable sip again: csrutil enable reboot your mac     you should also be able to edit the file directly after booting to recovery mode without disabling sip:  /volumes/name_of_main_volume/usr/bin/nano /volumes/name_of_main_volume/applications/utilities/boot\ camp\ assistant.app/contents/info.plist   you'd have to make notes how and what to add though because you may have no real internet access.    even if you can create a usb windows installer, this does not necessarily mean that you can boot your mac to windows using this flash drive.

if you can't erase the card from your camera does the camera at least recognize the card? can you take a picture and have it saved to the card? if not the card may be damaged or your camera's card reader may be damaged.  either way, try putting the card in a card reader attached to your mac's usb port (or if you have a later model macbook pro or imac, in the computer's built in sd card reader) and see if the mac recognizes it and mounts it on the desktop or in a finder window

the command-line way:  open terminal (/applications/utilities) and type  chflags hidden /path/to/folder   replacing /path/to/folder with the posix-style path to the folder you want to hide (for example, a folder on your desktop called test would be ~/desktop/test).  to unhide it, type chflags nohidden /path/to/folder.  the freeware way:  i haven't used it, but i've seen the app hide folders, by altomac.

as convenient as it would be, terminal can't easily provide the functionality you ask for.  the reason is that programs that run inside terminal have different rules for moving the cursor to the beginning/end of the line, for example:   bash (and other shells) use ctrla and ctrle vi uses 0 and $/shift4   other programs may use other keys
what you should do is similar in concept to the answer that you've quoted

indeed, itunes will simply throw in the trash any item that is replaced by a subsequent update, which is a handy getout clause if you notice that you need the old version back quickly, before you empty it, but isn't exactly a robust solution with long term options.  using time machine is a simple way of checking back through your history, and should be very effective on the understanding that you are using it regularly and to the normal hourly schedule, but may people don't have it setup, or use an external disk that is often not connected for long periods of time (guilty as charged).  so, they key is to get ahead of itunes, and create your own archive of apps, and you can break this down into 2 simple steps, the first being noticing when an app has changed, the 2nd being to do something about it.  you can happily write a script that you schedule to check for changes to select files and folders, but this is inefficient when you can simply use built in os features such as folder actions, which are a much neglected yet insanely useful and powerful set of tools.  a folder action is simply an action that is executed automatically whenever certain things happen within the folder to which is is applied
to check whether a disk drive is bootable, open terminal (in applications>utilities) and type (replace /volumes/ssd with the folder your disk drive is mounted at):  bless --info /volumes/ssd/   if the output looks similar to this:  finderinfo[0]:      0 =&gt; no blessed system folder finderinfo[1]:      0 =&gt; no blessed system file finderinfo[2]:      0 =&gt; open-folder linked list empty finderinfo[3]:      0 =&gt; no alternate os blessed file/folder finderinfo[4]:      0 =&gt; unused field unset finderinfo[5]:      0 =&gt; no os 9 + x blessed x folder 64-bit vsdb volume id:  0x844f837c9317318a   your computer won't be able to boot from the drive.  for comparison, this is what the output of a bootable disk drive would look like:  bless --info /  finderinfo[0]:     62 =&gt; blessed system folder is /system/library/coreservices finderinfo[1]: 327769 =&gt; blessed system file is /system/library/coreservices/boot.efi finderinfo[2]:      0 =&gt; open-folder linked list empty finderinfo[3]:      0 =&gt; no alternate os blessed file/folder finderinfo[4]:      0 =&gt; unused field unset finderinfo[5]:     62 =&gt; os x blessed folder is /system/library/coreservices 64-bit vsdb volume id:  0xd9a24bfa7a5e7edc   the command bless includes option --unbless to unset volume bootability (from man bless):     --unbless directory  use the hfs+ volume mounted at directory and unset any persistent blessed files/directories in the hfs+ volume                                 header.   so if you find out in the output above that your drive is bootable, "unbless" it:  sudo bless --unbless /volumes/sdd/

finder has supported merging folders since 10.7:    if the target folder has at least one file that is newer than the corresponding file in the source folder, finder merges the folders by keeping the newer files, and the merge button is shown as keep newer:    the dialog with the merge or keep newer button is shown if you copy a single folder but not if you move a folder or copy multiple folders.  another option is to use rsync:  rsync -ae ~/dir1/rootdirectory ~/dir2/   options:   -a: archive (-rlptgod or --resursive --links --perms --times --group --owner --devices --specials) -e: preserve extended attributes, resource forks, and acls -nv: show what files would be copied (--dry-run --verbose) --ignore-existing: don't replace files that are older in the destination --delete:  delete files from the destination that don't have corresponding files in the source

in terminal.app you can paste this command to find out which display you're using:  system_profiler spdisplaysdatatype   which should return all of your graphics/display information.   now the question is what is genuine? apple and just about every other company uses parts from many different manufacturers at any given time
i have restored plenty of ios 5 backups onto ios 6 devices so the problem here is almost certainly that the backup is now (and may have been all along) corrupt.  before throwing that backup away and restoring the itunes files from a backup of the computer where it was stored (hopefully you have that), you could try restoring the backup onto another device such as a borrowed ipad or ipod touch (or iphone) to be sure it's not the phone you are restoring the backup to.  the article itunes: about ios backups will help you locate where your computer stored this backup set as well as general info to support the idea that you can back up an older os onto a newer os (but not the other way around). 
apple has a support document for this, there isn't very much to add to it... 
aha, in mpeg streamclip if you select export as mp4, there is a crop checkbox and some textfields where you can type in the number of pixels to be cropped. 
i think i may have found an astoundingly low-tech solution to this problem, and it was right under my nose.  ever since ios became "multi-tasking" capable (i say that tongue-in-cheek, as we all know that most apps that get backgrounded aren't still running, they've just had their state saved until used again), the task switcher, accessible via a double-press of the home button, shows you a more-or-less "use-ordered" list of your apps

if you don't mind or are sure your recovery hd is patched to match the os on your main system, you can snag a file and see if it works without needing to do a full reinstall of the os and without needing a restart or an internet connection / saved installer.  use the recovery partition  many1 system files are also included on the recovery partition and can be copied over.   mount the recovery hd  diskutil mount recovery\ hd  mount the basesystem.dmg  hdiutil mount /volumes/recovery\ hd/com.apple.recovery.boot/basesystem.dmg  copy the file  file="/usr/bin/codesign" sudo cp -p /volumes/os\ x\ base\ system/${file} ${file}    this process can be combined into a single-line command if you have to run it frequently…  file="/usr/bin/codesign"; diskutil mount recovery\ hd &amp;&amp; hdiutil mount /volumes/recovery\ hd/com.apple.recovery.boot/basesystem.dmg &amp;&amp; sudo cp -p /volumes/os\ x\ base\ system/${file} ${file}   even if you have deleted the cp binary (which could happen), there is /usr/bin/ditto, /usr/bin/tar and several other commands that can stand in for cp.  reinstall os x  if you've got the ability to reinstall os x through the recovery hd, internet recovery or an os x install media then reinstalling os x will 'repair' your install and copy any missing/broken system files back to your system.    i recommend that you do a permissions repair using disk utility after copying a file manually and then rebooting
as seen on apple website, the supported video formats are:   h.264 video up to 720p, 30 frames per second, main profile level 3.1 with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps per channel, 48khz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats mpeg-4 video, up to 2.5 mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, simple profile with aac-lc audio up to 160 kbps, 48khz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats motion jpeg (m-jpeg) up to 35 mbps, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in ulaw, pcm stereo audio in .avi file format   so in order to play your divx movies you have either to transcode them into a supported format using tools like handbreak, or to jailbreak it so it will support more video formats.  in my humble opinion, apple tv is the best device for streaming music, listening/watching podcasts, streaming your photo libraries from your mac to your tv, and if you are an itunes store fanatic then buying/renting movies from the itunes store.  if your main interest is watching divx/mkv's, then i would suggest you to look for something else.

i found what looks like a workable route, but it's indelicate:  kill the 'loginwindow' process for a user (as root - the user can't kill its own process(!)) (note, the [n] prevents the regex matching itself), then use kill -9 -1 to catch the remaining mess:       $ for i in $users; do        echo $pword |        ssh $i@localhost '          sudo -s kill -9 $(            ps -axf | awk "/^ *$(id -u '$i') .*logi[n]window/{ print \$2 }"          );          kill -9 -1        ';       done   it leaves two processes around   /system/library/frameworks/coreservices.framework/frameworks/metadata.framework/versions/a/support/mdworker -s mdworker -c mdsimporterworker -m com.apple.mdworker.shared /usr/sbin/cfprefsd agent   ...which various mac pages claim are normal os x weirdness.  i don't particularly like this solution, because it's so abrupt and i'm concerned about leaving things like ios phone simulators or other files in inconsistent states, but the the absence of another answer, it seems i have little other choice.  at least i can use this as an emergency back-up for when the applescript route fails, and the kill -9 -1 tidies up what apple's normal but shoddy logout process leaves hanging around anyway.  i'll also note that doing anything with multiple desktop users messes up network connectivity for me, apparently due to apple not bothering to think through how authenticated networks should behave. 
you need to set the right permissions.  go into terminal and enter the following commands:  cd /library/startupitems   sudo chown -r root:wheel chmodbpf   you might need to restart the computer to take effect

the basic timemachine recovery procedure boils down to:  1) boot from recovery/installation media 2) make use of the disk utility (i recall under the tools menu option of the installation usb/dvds) to format/partition the new disk 3) then select/choose the restore/transfer option where you can then select the timemachine (or migration assistant) to restore from.  the problems i don't have an answer to as i've never done that in my setups:  a) recovery of the recovery partition..

ruling out a possible hack to get ios to run on a macbook natively (which would get a lot of publicity), i can see the following options   users didn't know enough about their system and just picked the things most likely (which means that you could have error reports from users with os x 10.7 on a macbook as well as from some with ios7 on an idevice mixed together) one or the other is just the default option when filling in a bug report on wherever you are getting them from and people are lazy users have been accessing your site via the ios simulator on os x
there won't be a problem.  i'm not 100% sure that upgrading to ios 8 will be in your best interest, though, because i've seen lots of reports of people with 4ss having performance problems on ios 8.

this depends how you changed your path.   if you changed it in your shell, just close the window and open a new shell. if you changed it in a profile, change it there.   your path should look something like this:  path=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/x11/bin

here is one way.  step 1   make a new sheet. make a table with one column and add your data to that column:   0.2 0.3 0.2 0.4   make sure that this first table does not have a header column or a header row.   step 2   in the same sheet as the first table, make a new table with two columns. give that table four rows (or more). in the new table, make the first column a header column. in that first column add in a list of values you want to 'count' on, e.g.:   0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4   in the second column, enter this formula in the first row =countif(table 1 :: $a$1:a$4,a1) where 'table 1 :: $a$1:a$4' is referring to the column of data in the first table, and 'a1' is referring to the cell in the first row of the first column in this second table. copy down the formula to the remaining rows in the second column of the second table.   you should end up with the second table looking something like:     0.1    0      0.2    2      0.3    1      0.4    1   step 3   select the second table and click the charts icon in the toolbar. the first chart type (vertical bar chart) should be what you need

for what it's worth, i just used homebrew (http://brew.sh/):  brew update brew install openssl brew link --force openssl    openssl version -a    if one of the bad versions come up (1.0.1a-f), you can figure out which version of openssl you're using, this way:  which openssl  often this is from /usr/bin
if you want to use a software, you can try lingon.  it allows you to manage (create, edit, delete) all the launchd items on your system.  otherwise, if you want to go by hand, look inside the following folders :   /library/launchagents /library/launchdaemons ~/library/launchagents  
ok so i got ahold of apple support and they helped me resolve the issue by deleting the keynote preferences file located at  ~/library/preferences/com.apple.iwork.keynote.plist  they instructed me to move it to the desktop for backup purposes and then reboot the system, after rebooting and opening keynote again the file was regenerated and the issue was resolved
you need add the sound file to /system/library/sounds/, or ~/library/sounds
yes, you can create your own spotlight importers.  you can find apple's documentation here.  the importers don't need to sit in /system/library/spotlight that is intended solely for importers that come with the operating system

i would use locking pliers to take it off, then take the screw to a local fastenings store who should be able to sell you a similarly sized screw with exactly the same thread.  you may want to add loctite, apple usually uses blue 242 loctite on their screws
it's less a bug than getting the people to send you an imessage to your email and not your phone number.  the database actually has two accounts for you and since they are not merged / unified on the server end, you will end up with two accounts / two endpoints and messages to one are not combined with messages to the other.  imessage in ios6 does a much better job of unifying several emails and phone numbers, but in 5.0.1 there is no unity

option 1: delete the update from your ios device.   go to settings from your home screen select storage and icloud usage go to "manage storage" find the ios update that is bothering you and select it tap on "delete update" and confirm   however, you'll have to stay off of wi-fi, otherwise it'll re-download.  option 2: block software update domains on your router / gateway  you'll have to figure this one out on your own, since all routers are different, but the domains you'll want to block are:   appldnld.apple.com mesu.apple.com   option 3: just update  you can also give in and submit to the installation

you should be able to do this via ethernet or wireless, depending on whether you want to buy a wireless dongle for your tv or whether you have the ethernet adapter for your macbook air.  if you have the usb ethernet adapter, you should be able to follow the instructions found here:   set up the sharing -the first step is to set up sharing on the host mac
you say the macbook is empty - does this not have any mac os on it?  to install from a usb or hdd you will need to open disk utility and from there select the restore option of the dvd with the hard drive or usb as destination, so if it does not have disc utility then no you can't, you will need to write a cd/dvd. 
i think your problem is that quoted form

the applescript for this is pretty simple:  tell application "itunes" to stop   you can make this easily accessible by creating a service.  open automator and create a new document
i know i'm replying on an old question, but i came in here googling. my iphone 4 had the same behavior, i just updated to itunes 10 and i my music is no longer greyed out.  in essence: upgrade to itunes 10 and you should be able to do this.

i can tell you, this isn't normal.  you shouldn't hear the hard drive very much at all, and only a little chatter when you're using it extensively.  since you've clearly established that it's a hardware problem (because pressure fixes it), you should probably try to get it fixed

well in my case it is right here    in your case it might be waiting for you in the "downloads folder" to be installed. if not get it from ms here http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1350 
first thing to try in these cases is to remove it via terminal:   open terminal type rm followed by a space drag the file into the terminal window (wait for the green + sign to appear, then release the mouse button) -> path to file should get added in the terminal window press enter     based on your additional information it seems to be phantom file only "known" to spotlight

env   just type this command into terminal
the best you can do is set a firmware password in hopes that someone won't change the boot options stored in nvram or let the keyboard select an alternate software to boot and bypass your administrative passwords.  older macs use open firmware to enforce this password, newer ones use efi password to prevent booting into single user mode.  physical access means with tools, your mac is vulnerable to physically reset the firmware password or remove the drive

there are several options to solve this:   if you are in a hurry, just format the external drive as hfs and drag whatever files/folders you wanna keep from the old mac to the external drive
the outer two are margin guides [the edge of the printing area], the inner ones are tab-stops; markers that text &amp; numbers will line up to if you separate them by using the tab key instead of just some spaces.    the orange lines are mine, for illustration. 'right tab' in the picture unfortunately has an accidental space after it, which stops it lining up with the orange line properly - my bad - but it illustrates that the space itself is included in the tab-stop.  you can see &amp; edit a tab function by right clicking a tab marker...    btw, if there's not enough room for the tabs, compared to the typed text, they simply don't [can't] work.  one last note - tabs are set for that line only unless specified globally before you start typing, or if you select all. 
if i'm not mistaken you could do that more or less easily:   say for example column comedy
it is tied to the new mac
here is the mountain lion end user license agreement that is your best starting point for what apple feels it has actually sold you for your money.  http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/osx108.pdf  of course, you'll want a lawyer to give you advice on what is customary, but the artwork isn't explicitly called out as something you are prohibited from using commercially
turns out i was wrong; you can configure this on iphone.  as the guide on this page taught me:   open settings scroll down to the application list and select facebook choose push notifications    now, in my case it was probably nearby friends that i mostly wanted to disable
if you switch powerpoint to display mode first, then switch to a mac app (using command-tab), then turn off mirroring, the setting should then stick
mount | grep /volumes/foo | cut -d ' ' -f1   or  mount | awk '/volumes\/foo/ { print $1 }'  
although you can use command-line tools to do this, apple has a developer tool that allows you to do what you are talking about from a control panel

column previews in finder are in fact provided by quicklook, not preview – as are the icons displaying the file contents, the coverflow icons and the quicklook preview proper you invoke by pressing space or cmd+y on a selected file.  quicklook uses plugins to display file contents – a piece of code rendering the file contents and telling the quicklook server it can do so (see the quicklook programming guide if you want the technical details)

to force the usage of the discrete graphics card in your macbook you can uncheck the automatic graphics switching checkbox in the system preferences/ energy saver panel   as the message states, this does drain the battery faster. however, your mac should not behave as you describe, i suggest taking it to a service desk so apple can take a look at it, or call apple to ask why it is so choppy. 
just like you would with a google search, use the double quotes operator to tell preview the result must be an exact match.  in your case, for example, typing "formation water" should yield the desired result.

your 500 gb disk has about 250 gb of unallocated disk space (starting at block 490620296 and ending at block 977105026).  to create a new partition in the unallocated disk space you have to boot to another boot disk.  preparation:   attach a backup drive and backup your drive. detach the backup drive restart to internet recovery mode by pressing alt cmd r at startup
if you don't need a internet connection during the lesson a simple solution would be to just switch into airplane mode or to disable the wi-fi. 
it's impossible (given the information in your question) to know what is making the file, but you can set a trap for it and see what process is writing to that file and hopefully which one re-creates it if you catch that moment in the filesystem logging.  you'll need to know a few things about the terminal to use the tool fs_usage and filter the results to match the exact path of the file.  on my machine, my home folder is named mike, so you can adjust the |grep /users/mike/1 command to match your user folder's name:  open the terminal app and type pwd and press return

executive summary: i don't believe this is possible, at least not for volumes formatted as hfs+.  my current understanding is that hfs+ chooses its file system block size (separate from the physical device block size) according to a fixed default allocation block size that cannot be manually overruled.    discussions in other forums spanning from 2002 to 2011 ( compgroups, macrumors among others) suggest using newfs_hfs(8), which has a -b &lt;blocksize&gt; option, to manually set the block size when creating a new file system.  i tried using newfs_hfs  on various kinds of partitions, on both .dmg diskimages and on physical sata hard drives (through sata&lt;->usb interface) and with various file systems (hfs+, fat16, fat32.)  when i ran newfs_hfs with different -b sizes (512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,) indeed it reported success in creating the filesystems with the specified block sizes

i know you have said you would rather not use an external hard drive, but my technique for storing films for itunes is to store them on the external hard drive and link them to itunes by dragging them whilst holding ctrl and shift (on a windows machine) which rather than copying into the itunes folder just short cuts to it effectively.

i'm guessing this isn't your preference, but the paid version of easy tether comes with the appropriate mac os x kernel extensions - so you could just pay the one time fee (currently $10) to have this feature programmed by someone who has done the work.  i'm fine with you not selecting this answer, but wanted it here for others that might need a solution that gets around the restrictions in the lite version of the tethering software.

a workaround would be:   create a temporary calendar from file>new calendar. mark the calendars you want to export:   depending on the time range you want to export select week or month view:   go to the week or month you want to export, press ⌘a to select all events and ⌘c to copy them. select the temporary calendar:    and press ⌘v to paste all previously copied events
this can be done by using the "new text document here" action  select folder -> tab -> start typing "new" -> select "new text document here" -> type name -> enter.  if you're looking for a more complete solution that can create any type of file (including ones without the .txt extension that the new text document action forces) try this applescript

it appears that the syntax must use single spaces, not tabs, to be recognised by the system.  this would fall in line with many command line processes; the only exception that springs to mind is the hosts file, which can use any amount of whitespace.  that would make the correct syntax    uuid=uuid_of_partition2_here none hfs rw,no auto   rather than     uuid=uuid_of_partition2_here       none    hfs     rw,no auto   ..

i'm assuming there is nothing on the usb stick you need to recover, since you were writing over it with dd.  plug it into your macbook and if it shows up with in /dev as a proper device, you should be able to use dd to clear the beginning and end of the stick to make it look like a brand new usb stick.  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk__ bs=1024 count=100  will clear the beginning of the stick

i used to get this issue as well and what i did was to prevent itunes from auto syncing when i connect a device, this option is found in the itunes preferences/devices and tick the checkbox as shown in the screenshot    it's also worth going into the user preferences then login items and remove "itunes helper" which should stop it from launching itunes anytime you connect a device. 
well - at the most basic level ios and mac os x are the same kernel and startup processes using launchd and standard unix-heritage programs.  ios has full sandboxing and arguably tighter access control infrastructure to build up - so in some ways, ios does more to start up than mac os x does.  once you add on mac things, of course it is more extensible so many people have much bigger loads to lift on an os x reboot than an ios boot.  i would argue that all the above arguments are moot and to a first approximation, you are seeing the cpu capability of the mac hardware shining as well as the read speed of the mac storage as opposed to the ios storage and the effects of more ram being a better advantage and more than offsetting the larger library and binary size on mac os x. 
just typing the operand not before the criteria will do the trick.  so, in this case, typing not .txt will show all the files but the ones with the .txt extension.

there used to be a way to do it cleanly in earlier version of the os but it is no longer supported.  i use a folder called "---------" which leaves a folder icon at the left edge.  patrick welker details a way of doing the same but not having the folder icon by replacing the smart folder icon with a transparent one( http://rocketink.net/2013/04/vanilla-finder.html) but that means any smart folders are iconless. 
mac os x mountain lion supports internet sharing using wpa/wpa2
currently, you have one thing against the feasibility, and that is google docs (even offline mode) is designed to work with the document you uploaded to google docs cloud (remember why google wants you to put everything on the cloud?)  if you don't feel like going to google docs and start uploading files manually, you can use cyberduck, to batch upload all your documents all at once, and then you can use google docs to access the documents.  note that i put bold on "currently"

strange i am having same issue when i log in
the finder's information should be refreshing automatically and instantly as files and information is changing that is the goal and why apple does not provide a "refresh" option, although in practice things sometime don't work for whatever reason.  if the information is not automatically updating changes to files etc, it may be the result of a bug or finder preferences corruption, or other corruption
sorry, but apple doesn't allow this, and it doesn't even look like there is a jailbreak tweak for this.

you don't need to worry about having to copy any data, making usb sticks or having the media present
since ross mcnab's answer appears to no longer work...  bookmark this (or any) page - then edit the bookmark - call it what you like, but change the url to...  javascript:alert(navigator.useragent)   now you can check your user agent any time you feel like conveniently from your bookmarks - thanks apple!  or if it's just a quick one-off check you want and you're connected to the 'net, do what t.j
yes you can, but you probably will not choose to do so
you unfortunately can't, there is no related application for ios right now
/etc/profile is set to read-only for all users, so just using sudo won't help.  what you can do:   run sudo emacs /etc/profile type c-x c-q to toggle readonly mode within emacs edit whatever you want type c-x c-s to save it   alternatively you can run  editor=emacs sudo -e /etc/profile   which automatically creates a temporary copy of the file you want to edit (which makes it a bit safer in case you want to cancel the update). 
two options:   you can repair permissions using target disk mode from your macbook - as you mentioned, you'll need a firewire or thunderbolt cable to do so
keynote (with iwork 09) does not have flash options/features in the export to html they were available only up to iwork 08
you can switch between an app's windows using a keyboard shortcut, a menu bar item, the app's dock icon, and mission control.  the keyboard shortcut to switch to the next window behind the current one is cmd+`
you can't - but why do you feel the need to 'close' apps - i.e
i had the same problem, with a usb disk drive
you could have used sudo opensnoop to see what files are being opened or fseventer to see what files are being modified.  those dialogs are often shown by applescripts that have reference a missing application

great question..
automatically through software update  it is likely that os x will automatically prompt you to download and install any recommended firmware update
manually start postgresql:  pg_ctl -d /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start   manually stop postgresql:  pg_ctl -d /usr/local/var/postgres stop -s -m fast   this stackoverflow discussion really goes into some great detail, with many more options
[edited to reflect screen shots]  technically that is 1 hard drive and 4 partitions (see how they are all indented from the drive they are in).  it looks like someone enabled showing all volume types in your disk utility so it's showing you things not normally shown in the gui.  os x has something like lvm so you are seeing the logical volume (lv) and the corestorage (pv) both shown as partitions in disk utility
grey, like everything in life you have choices
it seems like you might have cut-n-pasted the command in to the shell in some odd way - or you manually entered it in the wrong way.  try again, and this time pay attention to the quote characters
this worked for me     assuming you have already setup the alternate account in your gmail          remove the gmail account from your iphone     add new mail account      settings > mail > add account > other     enter standard gmail id and password in new account screen     enter standard gmail id and password in imap and smtp screens (imap.gmail.com, smtp.gmail.com)    after account is setup, under "imap account information" change address field to the desired account (note that the "incoming mail server" settings will remain as    gmail info, this is the difference between creating the account manually and using the automatic gmail setup)            enjoy   
custom text entry key bindings  os x has a very nice text editing system, which you can extend using key bindings
the option has been removed from the gui in os x 10.7 however you can enable it with a few commands
if you select an item or items and click on the “file” menu, there’s a “move to trash” choice; however, if you hold down the option key with that “file” menu open, “move to trash” will switch to “delete immediately....”  this also works with files already in the trash.

not using the all my files option, but yes you can, using your own search criteria.   open your volume in finder search for any document:   set the search location to the name of the drive:     alternatively, for all files (not just documents like all my files) you can set the search criteria by size:    you can change the view to make it match the appearance of all my files:   
for a small office, you may be able to get away with using busycal
there is an hd flag you can set in the file's header
a plausible way of resetting the password of your login on your os x is to:   go to single-user mode (cmd  + s on boot) type: /sbin/mount -uw / and press enter type rm /var/db/.applesetupdone and press enter type reboot and press enter.   on boot, you will be prompted to setup like if your mac was new
there is no way to import an aperture/iphoto library except start a new photos library and have it convert from an existing aperture/iphoto library.  i think the best solution would be to start a new photos library based on your existing aperture library

you can do it for a lot of apps [not all, but certainly all apple apps] from    system prefs > keyboard > shortcuts > app shortcuts   
xcode 5 requires 10.8.4 as a minimum.  if you have a apple developer account, you could try to download an older version (xcode 4.6.3 should work in 10.7 or 10.8).  however, xcode 4.6.3 is still a hefty download (1.81 gb)
if a filename starts with a dot (.), it is hidden and will not show by default in finder
my previous answer is preserved below.  you can use the chflags command to apply the hidden attribute:  chflags hidden /volumes/hide_this_disk   and to unhide:  chflags nohidden /volumes/hide_this_disk   these commands should take effect immediately.    you need to have the apple developer command line tools installed
you can't do it natively, and you can't do it through an app store app.  you'll have to jailbreak and search for a blacklist app on cydia.  of course you can disable sms and/or mms entirely on the device, but the iphone and ios is designed to have blocking enforced from the cell carrier and not the device

same answer as given here:  basically you want to use the system image utility to create a bootable .dmg you can than put on a usb drive. have a look at this post, it covers this process in detail (you probably can leave out some steps); this should get you started. 
you apparently can transfer the signature from your macbook to your mac mini

plugging in headphones used to be the quick and dirty way to assure silence (back in the ppc hardware days).  now, the self test startup chime still uses the internal speaker whether or not the headphone jack is in use, but the below trick will work on older macs
use  tmutil listbackups   to get a list of existing (completed) backups.  then run one or both of  tmutil compare # to compare current drive to latest backup tmutil compare /one/path/from/list /other/path/from/list # compare two backups  
though it's less and less true thanks to auto save, a shutdown in general may require user action (e.g., from an application that doesn't use the auto save model, or from an application that is frozen or becomes frozen when the os tries to quit it)
the 802.1x configuration is protected with keychain.  to remove it,  select a network configuration which isn't using your 802.1x setting.  then open keychain access (within applications/utilities).  unlock it
just put macpro back in the sharing field.  the .local is there to catch fully qualified domain names and help with bonjour - you can't avoid that, but it won't show up anywhere but that pane.   
it's a boring answer, but it looks like afloat has been updated to support lion:  http://infinite-labs.net/kb/afloat/af-lion.html 
not necessarily
homebrew  consider using homebrew to manage a private, isolated, installation of apache httpd on your mac.  to install brew and apache httpd on your mac, follow the steps on homebrew; the two main steps are:  ruby -e "$(curl -fssl https://raw.github.com/homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"   this will install the brew command line tool.  next use jabberwik's tap to install httpd:  brew tap jabberwik/homebrew-httpd brew install httpd24   mamp  an alternative approach is to use a pre-packaged application, such as mamp
go into the finder, type command + shift + u and open script editor by selecting it and typing command + o
you can pause the download while it's in the "loading" stage by tapping the app icon (tap again to resume), but i couldn't find a way to actually cancel the download. 
it's rather complicated, and actually a lot of the complexity is to avoid wasting space; i don't think you can "reclaim" anything without breaking it.  let me start at the beginning: your hard drive (/dev/disk0) has two relevant partitions: macintosh hd (your regular startup volume), and recovery hd.  recovery hd is marked in the partition table with the type apple_boot, but is actually in the normal hfs+ format
mac os x automatically keeps a database of all applications and their corresponding file-types called the launchservices database
both return and command + o work to open files in my version of coda.  is your enter key only an enter key or combined?  it doesn't look like that plug in changes key bindings so you might have to search elsewhere for something that is altering the standard behavior
if it helps, on 10.7 lion, i just use a global two-key shortcut in bettertouchtool (free/donationware) to start the screen saver and lock my mac
the easiest method to show which folder an email is currently located is to right click on the header bar in outlook and add the "folder" (visible columns have a check mark to the left of it) column to the current view

the wireless card in your imac, which is what is responsible for handling wifi connections, is only capable of one connection at a time, to explain it most simply
it's not using vlc (although it uses some of its components and should be able to open anything vlc can open), but it looks like there's a way to do this
tested:   there are 3 sound files for the 3 functions: start, cancel, and stop. they are called: dt-begin.caf, dt-cancel.caf, and dt-confirm.caf (respectively)
if finder thinks it is a bundle, maybe you can right-click on it and "show package contents"... 
edit: the option described below has been removed from chrome
it generally depends on being constantly connected (be it ethernet, wifi or some sort of 3g dongle) or not.  ultramobile and having the data everywhere where you have an internet connection: i personally have tried to host my 80gb itunes collection on a jungledisk (powered by amazon s3) and i can only say it's cumbersome
you can use the stacks feature on the dock to accomplish what you're asking.  you can drag and drop the macintosh hd (or any other folder) onto the right side of the dock, to the right of the separator line, to create a dock item
you can change the default preference easily:  system prefs > mission control > automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use.   
you should be able to use dd to destroy the partition's header
your home-sharing password is your apple id password
os x terminal does not source ~/.bashrc
if you have a keyboard similar to the one described here, it sounds like you can just pop the keys off and push them back down in the new position. 
imovie for iphone 4 does not offer the ability to separate the audio from the video of a movie
you can create two folder actions, one for images:    one for videos:    both should be setup to receive files from downloads folder
as has been said in the other answer, you are restricted to a single external display with the built-in hardware.  you can however add extra external displays using usb based display adapters
unfortunately, there is no way to do this in apple mail
getting the facetime.app file from your backup or another machine with the same os version should work. 
   q1: any ideas why the drive not showing up … (sometimes it does, other times it didn't)?   if the file system is dirty at time of connection of the disk, then the operating system will run fsck_hfs until (hopefully) repairs seem to succeed
neither macosx nor ios offer to change the os theme
if security is a major concern, i'd assume that a software hack is not the solution
i've seen reference to various itunes data anonymizer applications
this is rather easy combining some standard tools:   file for looking up the mime type tr to remove the slashes (otherwise, you'd have nested folders for different file groups) well, some obvious mkdir and mv commands     for file in * do     mime=$(file --brief --mime-type "$file" | tr '/' '_')     mkdir -p "$mime"     mv "$file" "$mime/$file" done   alternatively, you could also directly list file extensions for each expected mime type and automatically rename them appropriately.  for file in * do     mime=$(file --brief --mime-type "$file")      case "$mime" in     "image/jpeg")         extension="jpeg"         ;;     "text/plain")         extension="txt"         ;;     "application/pdf")         extension="pdf"         ;;     *)         continue;         ;;     esac      filename="${file%.*}"      mv "$file" "$filename.$extension" done   be aware, that for sake of readability i did not take care of file names containing spaces
as far as i can tell, the mac maintains two volume settings: one with headphones connected and another without headphones connected
first: the name "rootless" is misleading, since there's still a root account, and you can still access it (the official name, "system integrity protection", is more accurate)
a few solutions, not all of them good:   if possible, update to ios 5 (probably at the apple store) and don't use itunes. find a friend with a mac or a pc and get them to activate it. go to the apple store (as randolph said) and ask them. run windows in virtualbox (or another vm solution), and use itunes from there
in vmware fusion 3
there really doesn't seem to be a way to view this info at all on ios 5 ipads, in apple's "music" app
yes, if you download the same app off of the same account it will be redownloaded for free without charging your account again
a .dmg file is kind of like an usb stick in a file and can be handled more or less the same way

if apple's supported method of using the createinstallmedia tool doesn't work, you can try other options below:   https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201372     really - try the above if you can, but as an alternative, here is a simple recipe for making a usb version of the os x installer + associated tools

when you are done with the wizard, right click on the vm and select "settings" then pick "hard disk" then you should be able to move the cursor left and right to adjust the size of the disk. 
here is how i solved this:   launch address book go to preferences -> accounts tab -> on my mac item check synchronize with yahoo! box (which was unchecked for me) choose cancel in the resulting dialogue box   i can only guess that checking synchronize with yahoo! and canceling the resulting dialogue shook some sense into some forgotten settings. 
after days of searching i have found the solution
to show various drive icons on the desktop use the following commands in terminal:  external hard drives:  defaults write com.apple.finder showexternalharddrivesondesktop -bool true   hard drives:  defaults write com.apple.finder showharddrivesondesktop -bool true   removable media:  defaults write com.apple.finder showremovablemediaondesktop -bool true   (to complete all options available in the finder preferences: mounted servers:)  defaults write com.apple.finder showmountedserversondesktop -bool true   afterwards restart the finder:  killall -hup finder   to disable showing the respective desktop icons simply replace true by false 
at the time of writing rosetta is not included with lion, not supported by lion officially and not available from any other channel (official or unofficial) for use on lion.  so: no, there is no workaround
your question is probably about 5 ones about how things work, so i'll address the elephant in the room.  you need to decide how you want your photos to be stored.   where do you archive them for long term storage? how many can you afford to lose? when and how will you clean up all the photos that come from dozens of places so that your long term albums don't have hundreds of internet cat meme pictures and screen shots from ios?   i would recommend sitting down with a nice cup of tea or coffee and a large piece of paper and just list out what devices you want to take pictures from, what the master collection looks like, and how you'll manage things coming in to and out of that master collection.  once you've done that, you can look at icloud through a web browser - https://www.icloud.com/#photos and get a good picture of how close that "master collection" is to your ideal collection
i can't tell if this is serious or if i am being rickrolled, but the command below will attempt to download all images in numeric range 0000 to 9999
that sounds like an ideal task for itunes &amp; a single playlist sync.   launch itunes, connect iphone then select it from the top menu   click music in the settings section, not 'on my device' set 'selected playlists...' choose a single playlist to sync.    
one way to do this is to put the following command in ~/.profile:  export pager="col -b  | open -a /applications/safari.app -f"   the pager environmental variable controls what program man uses to display man pages
this should solve your problem: https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=12266  you have to edit the following file: /system/library/coreservices/dock.app/contents/resources/com.apple.dockfixup.plist  right below &lt;key&gt;add-app&lt;/key&gt;, you can remove all the &lt;dict&gt;...&lt;/dict&gt; related to the apps you don't want to appear in the dock on startup.

the ultimate problem here is that bash does not normally kill its non-builtin children.  if bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes. when bash is waiting for an asynchronous command  via  the  wait  builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which  the trap is executed.   when you hit &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;c&gt; you're killing the shell script, which behaves normally -- but the sleep lives on

it's not a question of licensing, it's that the architecture of the mac &amp; an idevice are totally different.  the mac runs on an intel processor, os x is based on a unix kernel.  idevices run on an arm processor, ios is [actually idk, but proprietary] (all idevices run on the same 'family' of processors, so that is why if you purchase an iapp, you can use it on any idevice you own.)  apps for one simply cannot run on the other

you'll want to be sure you have an allow rule with a lower number than the deny rule.  so perhaps:  00100 allow ip from any to any via lo0 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in   this puts the allow very low (make sure you don't have any deny rules in the 0-99 rule number range) and puts the general deny rule at a very high number (presumably you won't be allowing anything on port 80 higher than 90101).  if you are not defining a rule file to load all the commands in one shot, have a look at this answer for a slightly different take on restricting ports: how do i use ipfw to allow lan access but deny internet access?

launchd and the login items pane of accounts preferences are the two places that normally start a process when you log in.  if you don't see the item in system preferences -> accounts -> specific account ->  login items then you will have to look into launchd.  basically the launchagents and launchdaemons folders in ~/library  lastly, if they are not there, then it's a system level launchd task that you might want to use launchctl to show or look in /library instead of the user level library.  most people just have to manage the preference pane
iphone combines software and hardware that both designed by apple which drives to better performance.  iphone's body is aluminum compared to plastic of the galaxy s4.  iphone running ios, personally i think it's a better os.

you have to decide what you want in terms of storage, performance and os since there is no option to have 2x1tb drives in the $799 model and there's no option to have a 1tb fusion drive in the $999 model.  essentially, you're paying $200 more to get os x server and for the ability to have a second hard drive (doing it yourself is an option if you can follow guides on ifixit and have the tools and accessories required).    choose the $799 model with:   a 1tb fusion drive - $250 os x server - $19.99   total: $1068.99 (but you'll have a faster drive but half the storage space of the default $999 model).    choose the $799 model with the default 1tb drive:   add another 1tb 2.5" 5400 rpm drive - about $80+ (approximate cost from newegg) os x server - $19.99 the mac mini dual hard drive kit from ifixit - $49.95     total: $948.94 hassle of doing it yourself: priceless

mobile safari does not have that feature and the application sandbox means you likely won't get at that data from another app running on the device without jailbreaking.  many tools can export the browsing history to your computer - the trial version of phoneview might be good to start and see if that meets your needs.  history files in particular are stored as .webloc files

i was going to start explaining you what you can (and can’t) do or how hard was this going to be, but a single google query lead me to this excellent thread an apple forum.  i’m going to quote the relevant part, but i suggest you read it all because there’s more information there and more “why” questions.  we assume you have copied all the music to a central location (be it a machine or a nas drive or whatever), so somewhere in the network or your harddrive all your music files (library) are accessible to your wife and you (and theoretically both can write to that location, important when adding files)

in many countries, you can easily do this from itunes when signed in to a valid account with a credit card entered
you could try selecting the item and then viewing the dropdown list in view mode, not selection mode
some short tidbits, followed with analysis:   you don't need to pay for the os on a mac that shipped with lion or mountain lion. recovery hd ships with all the above macs, but it's not visible in disk utility and could also be deleted, corrupted, or suffer a hardware failure. internet recovery will let you re-download a recovery image from apple's servers even if there is no hard drive connected in your imac. booting from an external drive with os x or a recovery hd or a netboot drive (of which internet recovery is one free option) will allow you to totally wipe the entire drive in a mac. most people are fine using recovery hd to wipe their macs as it erases the entire macintosh hd portion and lest you start cleanly without needing to touch the recovery hd.     rather than boot to command-r, i would boot to the startup chooser (just hold the option key) which should paint a grey screen with both the macintosh hd and the recovery hd - letting you choose the second
"learn" means you are teaching this word to the machine so it knows the word for the future and even suggests you the word if you type it slightly wrong in the future.

this is a new feature of os x lion. lion automatically opens a web browser window when it detects that you need to agree to terms and conditions or log in to use the internet.  it's worth mentioning that the window isn't actually google chrome, but an operating system window that includes a webkit-based browser. 
yes, at the bottom of the service receives drop down you’ll find a no input option
there are a few devices i found that have been recently added to the market   garmin ant+ adaptor for iphone wahoo key for iphone   both allow you to connect and record in real time exercise data in association with their and other third party apps (garmin fit and wahoo have a list here)  what i have not been able to confirm is whether it will provide upload facility from devices after being out of range as you want
this looks more like a ssl negotiation error; i suspect this is a settings issue, not so much a certificate issue;   an incorrectly configured proxy (possibly on the shared connection or even on the phone)  a mismatched ssl/tls setting (e.g
this is technically not an answer to the question asked, but rather an answer to your problem as described
if you are using the terminal client, generally you can do things like reset the root users password for mysql or create databases. a simple example can be found at the mysql docs site, of which i will copy the highlights.  to create a new mysql user:   login to mysql in terminal:mysql -u username in the prompt:create user 'admin'@'localhost'; grant all privileges on *.* to 'admin'@'localhost'; if you want to create a database: create database name; is all you need to do   if you do decide to use mysqladmin, mysqladmin can create and drop databases, but it cannot create new users
sounds like your dns might be hijacked, which could be your router or your mac.  i'd suggest using opendns for a while to see if the behaviour stops
you can plug a standard apple 30pin usb charging cable into the galaxy tab charger and it will work fine
you should:   understand pf basics - here is many guides on the internet, you can safely read any open/free bsd guide
certain upgrades are possible, but it’s not that simple.   accelerate your mac is a nice source of information, you can find them here. anandtech did change the cpu of a mac pro. owc mac sales does have memory upgrades (there are others). video card: unless you want to experiment with modified firmwares, your only choice in that model is the ati 4870, which is considerably faster than the regular nvidia (it’s very noticeable in x-plane and 3d applications) but still lagging behind the “latest offerings”
apple has made it impossible to include an image in a signature since ios 9.3 which is totally rediculous
found the answer here, though there is some discussion about the details.  in short, the mac will pick up a host name from the dhcp server
yes - there are open source libraries to do this without needing to jailbreak the device.   http://www.libimobiledevice.org/   you might be able to use homebrew to install that package, but i'd guess the http://askubuntu.com people would be better suited to getting the software running now that you know it exists.   http://askubuntu.com/a/704677/21224   and, it seems you don't even need any software as this feature is built into  ubuntu
you can always use apple feedback page to submit any kind of request.  if you have this problem in our own itunes library, it is easy to assign a new cover to the song or album by just dragging the cover to it or using the getinfo option, you know how to do this right?  if you install last.fm app you can simple play a song and then drag the last.fm cover into the artwork of the itunes song. 
you could make new cfbundledocumenttypes entries in  /applications/textwrangler.app/contents/info.plist
yes - whether you have a usb or other direct drive or a network drive, time machine will cooperate with different mac backing up to the same destination
are you sure that it's not to be found?  if i look at preferences → settings → keyboard, the checkbox for use option as meta key is at the bottom.  i am on 10.7.1 so it may be something overlooked in the gm of lion and fixed in the first patch. 
you only have bookkeeping files on that partition
if you want to find out how much space an application and it's associated files are taking up (not just the .app bundle), appcleaner works great for that

you should be able to download yosemite from the app store if you login with an account that had previously acquired it.  if the usb stick was made with an app store copy of "install os x yosemite.app", it will work on any hardware that existed prior to the release of the copy you downloaded
you've got it exactly right.  in the video, the person had set up the phone to recognize 'home' as a specific address
this works just like other im apps which do this
the find my mac feature can be enabled and disabled in the icloud settings (system preferences &rarr; icloud)    you cannot disable just the "erase" feature: the locate, lock and erase features must be managed as a single option.

unfortunately, the firmware signing window has since closed for ios 8.4.1 (as well as all earlier ios builds for your device), so it should not be possible.  source: https://ipsw.me/8.4.1 
that's a third-party cable, not an official apple cable, so what's probably happening is that for some reason that cable is bridging the 2nd and 11th pins, telling the device to send the audio out the 3rd and 4th pins:  from http://pinouts.ru/portabledevices/ipod_pinout.shtml:           2  gnd     audio &amp; video ground (-), internally connected with pin 1 on ipod motherboard      3  right   line out - r (+) (audio output, right channel)      4  left    line out - l(+) (audio output, left channel)      11     audio_sw    if connected to gnd the iphone sends audio signals through pin 3-4, otherwise it uses onboard speaker

at this time, no, you can only delete them one at a time by clicking 'edit' and then 'delete'.  you can always submit feedback about this on the icloud feedback page, or if you have a developer account, you can submit a bug report on this as well.  i personally wish these rules could be as strong as some of those in mail.app, as well as synced between the two (icloud mail on the web, and mail.app on the computer).

hard linked files share the same inode (which kind of identifies the file in the filesystem)
one can use any vpn for tunnel to any available country for beats 1 radio.  it seems that requests only to itsliveradio.apple.com should be tunneled (so your connection speed would not be affected that much because of vpn).  example workflow:   use tunnelbear to tunnel to uk or us in its preferences set tunnel to only itsliveradio.apple.com url.  
it's not advertised all that well, but apple still sells the non-thunderbolt 27" led display (apple store us link).  as cajunluke points out, there are other good 27" displays out there, notably by dell and hp, just be careful that you're getting one that isn't low resolution (1920x1080 on a 27" won't look great - the good ones are 2560x1440), and has a native displayport input - as you may be aware, the minidisplayport to dual-link dvi adapters have some issues. 
as apple states in the link you mentioned:     for best performance, fill both memory slots, installing an equal memory module in each slot.    get one more 4 gb memory stick and install it. there is no need to throw your existing one and get two of the same kind, since memory chips are rigorously tested for compatibility, especially if you buy from a seller like owc - macbookpro memory or datamem - macbook pro memory. the memory sellers would also provide you with the right memory for your system.  
assuming you are running yosemite...   open a finder window and navigate to the parent folder that contains all of these files. hit cmd and f to convert it to a spotlight search window. select your folder as the search target in the bar just under the toolbar (in the screenshot below i've selected "downloads")

this problem is solved with itunes version 11. it simply offers a checkbox to synchronize new apps automatically and that just works as expected. i did this on 2 different windows machines (win7 and win8) with the same iphone and no application data got lost
as tom pointed out, xcode is only available in english on the mac app store !   if you look on other apps you'll see the available localizations for example on apple's number. 
considering how much an iphone costs, take it back
you can kludge something together with some applescript and some clever icon image pasting
i'm not sure if this will work in your case, but someone on this forum seems to have had some success in a similar situation by simply changing the file extention from .mp4 to .m4v.  they were also using handbrake.

if you have purchased/downloaded the app with your apple id, you would still be able to download the app from the "purchased" section of the app store even if the app has been removed from the shelves. 
you may need to set up port forwarding so that you can connect to your server even though it's behind nat from your router. 
another way to convert non-ascii characters to ascii variants is to use iconv -t ascii//translit:  $ echo ‘’“”–—…äé | iconv -t ascii//translit ''""--..."a'e   ascii//ignore would remove non-ascii characters, but you can also do that with for example tr -dc '\0-\177'.

textmate can use either the file extension or the first line of a file to divine what filetype it is.  for my diff bundle (i think it's the original), this is:  firstlinematch = '(?x)^         (===\ modified\ file         |==== \s* // .+ \s - \s .+ \s+ ====         |index:\          |---\ [^%]         |\*\*\*.*\d{4}\s*$         |\d+(,\d+)* (a|d|c) \d+(,\d+)* $         |diff\ --git\          )     ';   i don't have mercurial, but it appears as though its diff's first line may look something like diff -r 2278160e78d4 hello.c

i use the glims plugin for this, which has a host of other useful features, too. 
you can just setup a global keyboard shortcut for it in system preferences -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> mission control  or if you definitely want it from the command line, an applescript to do this (assuming you setup the keyboard shortcut to use cmdshiftoptctrld.  note that you still must setup a keyboard command in system preferences for this to work.  put the below script into a file, say, ~/dnd.applescript  ignoring application responses     tell application "system events" to keystroke "d" using {command down, shift down, option down, control down} end ignoring   now you can run osascript ~/dnd.applescript from the command line to toggle your dnd setting.  screencap:   
actually there is a plugin (not to be confused with an extension) called glims which allows the tabs to have a minimum width roughly the size of the close button
i think you should be fine
iphoto supports sharing of albums (including synchronising of comments, and name/face tagging) with facebook.  this allows you to select a group of photos, and either put them into a facebook album or post direct to a wall
this seems to be fixed in 11.0.4:   
you can change terminal only with this one command to write a new preference for that specific app.  defaults write com.apple.terminal nsquitalwayskeepswindows -bool false   this is general, so of course, substitute safari or quicktimeplayerx or whatever in the com.apple.terminal portion of the command as needed
unfortunately, this is not possible due to current app store limitations unless someone else with a jail broken iphone that you trust has a copy of it that you can grab

i believe the solution to the problem is to prevent mail.app from tracking previous recipients
to tell if you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit kernel (which matters for some device drivers), launch system profiler and click on the "software" heading in the contents section.  the line "64-bit kernel and extensions" will say "yes" if you are running the 64-bit kernel and "no" if you are running the 32-bit kernel. 
it's rather simple
mdls lists file metadata
this superuser post worked for me:     you need to browse to the application that you’d like to use to open these files, and edit its bundle
two things - if you don't know the basics of a unix shell syntax (having a space in the right place matters, punctuation like / matters) don't do step 2 unless you can afford to re-install everything again - the rm command is unforgiving - delete the wrong file or directory with rm -rf and the mac won't boot
unfortunately, you can't do it on ios. 
this has been the behaviour in os x's window system since at least the original os x (10.0), and probably is consistent back to classic mac os (if that's the case, it likely dates back to system 7 or system 6 with multifinder).  in any case, this is how it is: to my knowledge, there's no way to change it.  the best you can do is to not leave outlook's window open all the time
the solution to my particular problem is to be found here which suggests excluding the process msmpeng.exe from the windows defender service
save dialog specific shortcuts:  to save, simply press return   to cancel, hit esc or cmd+.  if you do not want so save, hit cmd+d or cmd+backpace  using tab:  if you want to use the tab key, you should enable keyboard access by hitting ctrl+f7 note: depending on your setup, you might need to additionally press fn to use the function keys.   once you've enabled keyboard access, you should see an additional blue glow around the currently selected button
the contact numbers will be retained on your iphone and transfer to your new appleid.  what you will want to do is sign out of your old appleid on the phone and then go into icloud.com under your old appleid and delete everything you no longer want there.  when you create a new appleid the contacts and other info will be uploaded to your new appleid account.  at least that is how it is supposed to work

you can't actually increase the resolution of your display, as the panel is lcd and only has 1280x800 physical pixels.  you can however install and run apple's xcode from the app store to allow your mac to display resolutions (among many other things) found on other macs to simulate the higher resolutions.  the display will be very pixelated and blurry though, as it's going to squash the visual elements from a larger virtual display onto a smaller physical display.  it has it's uses if you're a developer as you can design screen elements for larger displays and zoom to your native resolution in to see how they look, but i wouldn't recommend it for actual day to day use. 
the install app that you download from the mac app store is a universal installer that isn't tied to a specific model/build
try going to settings > sounds and setting 'change with buttons' to off. 
check in ~/library/services/
which model of mac pro do you have? if it really is a 2006 model, that sounds like a macpro1,1, which isn't supported after lion (10.7) as it has 32-bit efi even though its cpu(s) are 64-bit

to be concise: the symbol you're asking about, the circle with the arrow escaping from it (that's the way i remember what it means), is the apple way of saying 'the esc key'.  so the menu item ⌥⌘⎋  is option+command+esc pressed simultaneously. 
it works for me, but i have it remapped like this:     so cmd is really control for windows

there's a plugin for safari called glims that lets you add different search engines (including wikipedia) to the search bar among other tweaks
automatically added keys  there are three ways ssh keys are added to ssh-agent in snow leopard.   manually, with ssh-add, automatically, by ssh when you supply a key’s passphrase via the gui prompt, and automatically, by ssh-agent when it first starts.   the last two methods are apple extensions: there are no “automatic” additions with stock openssh
textedit and other app have a auto save feature enabled.  you can disable that in system preferences:  open the general preferences and enable the "ask to keep changes", so it wont auto save, but ask you if you want to save it
it may be due to acls

you can edit bash profile with vi ~/.bash_profile make sure the path was not added in ~/.bashrc or to /etc/profile  to remove the path you can either remove it from the file where it was added, or simply re export the ones you need export path=/here/is/one:/here/is/another 
in this knowledge base article, apple write "with find my iphone set up on your iphone, ipad, or ipod touch or mac, you can locate, display a message, play a sound, remotely lock, or remotely wipe (erase) your device using the find my iphone app from another device (such as a friend's iphone or ipad)."  this is the closest i have found to a direct statement that it's one package: if it's set up, you can locate, display a message, play a sound, lock, or erase
i am not sure, but this may work
if it's your first backup in lion, you need to leave the computer awake and connected to the time machine volume and let it do its thing, perhaps overnight

practically speaking, the answer would be no - icloud doesn't "sync" multiple email accounts (this is built into ios)
short answer....no if your system is unsupported then you cannot install mavericks no matter how much memory you have
if you've been to the apple store, and had repairs done on the computer, its most likely the logic board

macs introduced after 10.7 was released (and mid-2010 to mid-2011 macs with a firmware update) support internet recovery: if you start up with a new hard drive, you are shown a gray screen like this and something like the contents of the recovery partition are downloaded over the internet:    http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4718     if you happen to encounter a situation in which you cannot start from the recovery system, such as your hard drive stopped responding or you installed a new hard drive without os x installed, new mac models introduced after public availability of os x lion or os x mountain lion, automatically use the os x internet recovery feature if the recovery system (command-r method above) doesn't work
i'm going to take a wild stab in the dark guess and say that this is related to the highly documented "mountain lion wake bug" (at least that's what i've dubbed it.)   it's been discussed in a variety of threads on apple support forums, but probably the most successful i found was this one
the second part of that statement "or all flash storage" is universally true
you could submit an issue to "apple bug reporter"  even though it's called "bug reporter" you can also use it to submit enhancements, suggestions, feature requests, ui/usability issues, etc.  to sign in you need an apple id which you probably have anyway.  in a way you also "share this to other people" in this way, because if other people submit similar issues to bug reporter it can be linked to your issue, so that they know someone else reported something similar already. 
so, this is easy to solve in excel..

you can use x lossless decoder(xld) too:     x lossless decoder(xld) is a tool for   mac os x that is able to   decode/convert/play various 'lossless'   audio files
from my understanding the actual components that need to be removed first are in /system/library/java/javavirtualmachines/*.jdk  so if you get rid of those:  $ sudo rm -rf /system/library/java/javavirtualmachines/*   also, as you mentioned, you're supposed to remove this:  $ sudo rm -rf /library/internet\ plug-ins/javaappletplugin.plugin   at this point it should simply be a matter of downloading 1.6 and installing it

in any of the common scenarios in which you store your store credentials on devices under the control of others, it makes good security sense to have those be different from the ones you use for icloud
according to the mavericks how to upgrade page you can update from snow leopard (10.6.8) lion (10.7), or mountain lion(10.8) later to mavericks (10.9) if your hardware meets the requirements, which yours does
try killall finder in terminal.app. 
an epub file is essentially just a zipped folder, though it has a mimetype file inside which apparently needs to not be compressed.  this would imply that it's not completely straightforward to recreate with a simple zip app
 right-click on the podcasts entry in the side bar select "export..." select opml format   this gives you a short file listing all the subscribed podcasts including the url. 
i'm pretty sure this was happening because when i logged out, i was running an app which was located on the other computer.  i logged off and unchecked the "reopen windows when logging back in" box, which stopped lion from trying to reopen the app the next time i logged in.   
there is no official way to do so, but if you've jailbroken your ipad, you can use stayopened
try prefs/search - disable everything except search engine suggestions [which are 'live' not historical]   
i did some more digging and i managed to find a solution that isn't applescript-ed ui movements.  you can script most of the settings changes i wanted to make using the defaults command (wiki).  as for figuring out the actual keys/values that correspond to the ui preferences, i've found lists like this to be useful (this one too)
it depends on the finder view mode

to get the settings:  networksetup -getdnsservers airport   to change them:  networksetup -setdnsservers airport xx.xx.xx.xx   these settings are non-persistent, so you could clear your manual settings, let the public wi-fi dns do its thing, then use the -setdnsservers to set it to what you want until next time. 
my setup is the following :    macbook pro 2009, 13" ssd (intel x25m postville) replacing the superdrive, used as system + home folder disk factory hdd used for music and pictures storage   i tried to move my home folder to te hdd, here are my conclusions :  when you move your entire home folder to an hdd, your mac boots fast, but you don't get too much performance gain while opening applications (even apps that do not use any document, like safari)
it depends on the cause of the yellowing.  i personally have seen the following situations:   psycological yellow where any time you have a black border and a white area, the brain will color the white yellow

i reinstalled the os and the problem went away. i'll mark this answer as correct until someone comes with a better one. 
the solution for me was to use the adapter with a three pin extension cord.  then you're notebook is earthed and no more charges stay on the cover that shock you :-).  about steps 1-3  in steps 1 and 2 you reset the system management controller (smc reset) on a mac that has a battery which you should not remove on your own
you can do this with alfred powerpack and key clue workflow

i have a similar workflow that i've used in safari and i've used the edit name feature to make it easier to move from one site to another.  if i bring up a chart of sso in stockcharts.com and create a bookmark, the bookmarks toolbar menu shows it as sso - stockcharts workbench - stockcharts.com.  then i "show all bookmarks", right-click (control click) edit the name sso - stockcharts workbench - stockcharts.com to be just sso.  this now appears as sso on my bookmark toolbar list

my own answer will be not applicable to any situation, but here is how i solved the problem.  all the data i needed from app in question (x) can be easily extracted once the app (with its data) is installed on the device.  so i did the following:   backup the latest state to itunes (saving a previous backup with "archive" just before doing that) restore to the previous icloud backup where the x app was still installed and had data extract all the data i need from x (i'm my situation, via itunes > (my device) > apps > documents section restore back to the latest itunes backup made in step 1 re-install the x app in question from the scratch.

to give you an answer the best i can with the research i've done
i figured out why it was taking so long
you could use itunes wi-fi syncing.  prior to ios 5, you would have to plug in your device to sync with itunes.  as of ios 5, 2 new features were introduced:   icloud wi-fi syncing with itunes   for people like me that mainly used itunes for backup purposes, icloud eliminated the need for syncing with itunes altogether
converting a single file without preserving tags  brew install lame flac --decode --stdout test.flac | lame --preset extreme - test.mp3    --decode --stdout = -dc lame - $outfile = input from stdin --preset extreme = ~245 kbit/s vbr     a shell script that preserves some id3 tags  #!/bin/bash  for f in "$@"; do     [[ "$f" != *.flac ]] &amp;&amp; continue     album="$(metaflac --show-tag=album "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"     artist="$(metaflac --show-tag=artist "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"     date="$(metaflac --show-tag=date "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"     title="$(metaflac --show-tag=title "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"     year="$(metaflac --show-tag=date "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"     genre="$(metaflac --show-tag=genre "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"     tracknumber="$(metaflac --show-tag=tracknumber "$f" | sed 's/[^=]*=//')"      flac --decode --stdout "$f" | lame --preset extreme --add-id3v2 --tt "$title" --ta "$artist" --tl "$album" --ty "$year" --tn "$tracknumber" --tg "$genre" - "${f%.flac}.mp3" done   to use the script, just save it somewhere like ~/bin/flac2mp3 and make it executable with chmod +x ~/bin/flac2mp3.  this would convert all flac files in your music folder:  find ~/music/ -name '*.flac' -exec ~/bin/flac2mp3 {} \;   or slightly faster, since it only calls flac2mp3 once:  find ~/music/ -name '*.flac' -print0 | xargs -0 ~/bin/flac2mp3  
yes!  you can drag the text bubble bounding box (the blue dots that you would use to resize the bubble) over to the other side.  this effectively over-"resizes" the bubble so it is mirrored. 
here is the solution. the script that generates the link, generats a url that starts with a custom googledrive:// and then the path to the file in the google drive folder.  i then set lincastor to trigger the following script for urls beginning with googledrive://  on handle_url(args)     set theunixpath to |url_path| of args     set theunixpath to (posix path of (path to home folder)) &amp; "google drive" &amp; theunixpath     set themacpath to (posix file theunixpath)      #display dialog "handle url: " &amp; themacpath       tell application "finder"         set theitem to item themacpath         if (class of theitem) is folder then activate         reveal theitem     end tell     activate application "finder"      return 1 end handle_url   the script is super easy, it takes the url, attaches the path to the user homes folder and /google drive/, then uses this generated path to open the finder and reveal the item 
using ios 6.1.2 it is pretty straight forward (i have no older version of ios with me to check how and if it works there, but i guess it will).  tab on the task/reminder you would like to move to another list
a multi-output device allows you to mirror audio output to multiple devices at the same time.  an aggregate device allows you to tie multiple devices together to appear as one, single, device with more i/o than any one single device has.  aggregation has a lot of applications in music production where you might want to use more than one audio capture device at the same time from logic audio or garageband
yes, you can absolutely delete the folder developer-3.2.5 - it shouldn't effect your workflow in any way unless you want to add an older sdk at a later date.  if you are interested in seeing more discussion about it, there is also an apple support community thread that essentially says the same thing - that you don't need the folders.

you can't, as apple doesn't provide this ability.  from apple's support document:     you cannot merge two or more apple ids into a single one
i don't think single user mode is really what you want.  a better idea is to use a console login.  to do this, first you have the login window set to show “name and password”:    then you can login as ">console" as the username (no password) and get a terminal prompt.  it's not very pretty, but it's handy if you need it. 
following the instructions on apple's deregister imessage should help you resolve this issue. 
in itunes, go to the menu view -> view options.  expand the file triangle, and check “kind”  you can now sort your songs by file type by clicking on that column header, and they cluster by album.  alternately, make a smart playlist that includes files by their kind or size, and use the view dropdown in the top right to view it by artist list (or grid, but i assume you have your music collection sorted by artist.)

are these shares automounted?  you could use applescript, or even bash quite effectively to do this using a log out hook (or running manually):  tell application "finder"     if ((count of disks) &gt; 1) then         set drives to disks         repeat with drive in drives             eject drive         end repeat     end if end tell

if you've got tabular data (which it sounds like you do), using a table is perfectly appropriate.  the other way is with tabs
if you're able to save the file you'd like to play as a ringtone, then the iphone can play it once the timer hits zero
although i don't feel this question is appropriate for here, there is an article published by apple on their take of jailbreaking:  apple: jailbreak  essentially, it is modified software
you could create an automator service like this:    this takes the selected files and creates hard links to them in the directory where they exist
upgrading to yosemite did make things quite a bit better
sadly (it happens to me too), most of these pages use either a meta  &lt;meta http-equiv=”refresh”&gt;   or some form of javascript to accomplish the reload every xx seconds
i just leave my iphone in "airplane" mode after arriving at my destination (it is reassuring to know that this is enabled since you can easily see the airplane icon in the menubar so you know that you will not be sending/receiving any cell data)
yes, by putting the following line in your ~/.bash_profile file:  alias brewu='brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade --lock'   brewu can be replaced by whatever alias you want to use
as a one-time thing,  open -a /applications/textwrangler.app myfile.txt open -b com.barebones.textwrangler myfile.txt # same thing by id   you can also create an alias for opening textwrangler, that you would put on the .bash_profile file, which is an hidden file by default that is usually in your home directory

you might not be happy with the current functionality of itunes, but here's how to works
go to system preferences > keyboard > shortcuts and there will be various shortuc setups for almost anything
you can simply uncheck reopen windows when logging back in when rebooting ( -> restart):   sadly there doesn't seem to be a preference to make this change permanent
i had the same "issue" with my iphone 1
have you seen vimium for chrome?   i'm not sure if there is a way to hide the toolbar in chrome, but the vim extension for safari might be the last step you need for navigating using only the keyboard
 shift+command+h takes you to your home folder command+uparrow takes you one folder up   have a look at the "go to" menu in finder for additional key combinations
so i rebuilt my entire itunes library only to discover the problem was that i'd told itunes to sort by year
how did you switch control and command ? did you use the "modifier keys" tab from system preferences > keyboard ? by doing so, your keys will be switched on all the apps

bootcamp allows you to install and run windows 7 natively on your mac as if it were just any other pc.  it allows you to co host a windows installation on the same drive as your mac os one, allowing you to dual boot
from the menu bar select system preferences  select the keyboard icon   select the keyboard tab  select the "show keyboard &amp; character viewers in menu bar" check box.  from the menu bar select either the character or keyboard viewer.   
i have also been bothered by this and some trial and error led me to discover that the login screen keyboard focus problem is not caused by the display turning off
it doesn't appear that your mbp is capable of driving 2 4k displays with the macbook's primary display working (see graphics and video support):  https://support.apple.com/kb/sp704?locale=en_us  also the owc dock isn't capable of driving 2 4k displays so even if your mbp is capable of driving the displays you'll need to use the hdmi port or one of the other thunderbolt 2 ports to drive the second display:  http://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt/thunderbolt-2-dock-overview  one thing you may be able to try is to close the macbook to turn off it's primary display, thus freeing up resources to try to handle both 4k displays. 
i highly recommend importing your photos at full resolution, on the off chance that you ever want to crop or make a big print or display on a high res screen in the future
4gb of ram isn't much to be running all of those heavyweight apps at the same time

it may be a bug, but i am thinking it may mean your spotlight index is corrupt
i outlined how to do this at http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/07/terminally-geeky-use-automatic-login-more-securely/ but i will summarize it for you:   set your account to autologin create a login item (using launchd) which calls:      /system/library/coreservices/menu\ extras/user.menu/contents/resources/cgsession -suspend   note: that command should be one long line not two lines with a line break/line feed.  a more thorough explanation is available at tuaw, so i won't repeat it all here, because those are the relevant details.  what it does:  the idea is very simple, your account is set to auto-login, so all of your login items will run, however, one of those login items (the cgsession command listed above) will tell the loginwindow to appear

i am assuming that you sync your iphone to itunes on either windows or mac, and that these  contacts are then displayable in apple address book or an equivalent program on windows (microsoft outlook, etc.).  the procedure would be to sync all your contacts from the iphone to the mac or windows program, then use that program to export the contacts in a database format that could then be imported into the htc desire software, or the software on mac or windows that you use to sync data with your htc desire.  update:  since you have indicated that you are using the iphone to sync to itunes on windows, then this forum may not be the best place to ask this question
you don't need to use a separate application
7 simple steps to solve the problem (works even in os x 10.11.1):   go to /private/var/db/locationd/ from your finder or terminal; give you full privilege to change files inside this folder; convert clients.plist file from binary mode into xml1 by running this command in your terminal: sudo plutil -convert xml1 /private/var/db/locationd/clients.plist; open the clients.plist and remove the key and dictionary pair in the configuration file

given the rather tricky use of hard-linked directories, access control settings and other special filesystem features i doubt that you will find a cloud storage which supports all this.  options you may want to consider:   copy the whole time machine drive into the cloud as an image (requires a lot of bandwidth at least for the initial copy) use rsync to periodically copy your data to a remote (cloud) system  
the black background is just because black is the absence of any other image there

from some experimentation here (not official documentation, so interpret accordingly), it appears that   you can run most applications successfully from any folder, but yes, there are some special properties of the /applications folder.   i include the caveat "most" in point #1 because any application could be written to contain a script that (unwisely) had a hard path coded in it to /applications/app name.app/contents/whatever, in which case it would break if run from somewhere other than the /applications folder

if you want to have the private key actually stored in the secure enclave you need to be running at least ios 9 and you must generate the keypair using the seckeygeneratepair() function.  this means that the private key is stored in the secure enclave, while your app gets the public key.  note that this also means that:  a) you cannot use a private key you have generated yourself in your own code, or retrieved from somewhere else (like one of your servers)  b) you cannot retrieve the private key, so you must use the secure enclave functions for actually encrypting with the private key.  if your app requires you to do either of those, you can generate a keypair using the aforementioned function and use it to encrypt your own data (i.e

you can edit any icon by right-clicking (control-clicking) the application, choosing get info, and dragging the replacement icon over the original icon at the top of the window that appears.  you can also copy and paste the image you'd like to use as an icon, as mentioned in apple's documentation.  this works for files or folders you'd like to change the icon for. 
with ios5 and icloud, ical's reminders appear in the reminders app.

have you seen this other question / answer?  how do you convert video within 10.7 without any 3rd party software      the finder has built in video encoding and you could even use these to set up watch folders and attach a pre-set conversion using automator if you found one setting that you prefer... 
this cannot be done automatically across the computer, but there is a way to do this quickly to a group of directories:   select the files/folders you want to change the icon of open the inspector (right click -> get info) or command + i drag a new icon   using inspector will be best because you can select multiple files to change the icons of at once.  also, as stated in this link, apple will display file previews for some items by default.  dynamic previews documentation: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201067  how to change file icons, as described above: https://support.apple.com/kb/ph13922?locale=en_us

as @khedron says, you can see this info in activity monitor.  if you want it on the command line, here is a python script that i wrote (or perhaps modified from someone else's, i can't remember, it's quite old now) to show you the wired, active, inactive and free memory amounts:  #!/usr/bin/python  import subprocess import re  # get process info ps = subprocess.popen(['ps', '-caxm', '-orss,comm'], stdout=subprocess.pipe).communicate()[0] vm = subprocess.popen(['vm_stat'], stdout=subprocess.pipe).communicate()[0]  # iterate processes processlines = ps.split('\n') sep = re.compile('[\s]+') rsstotal = 0 # kb for row in range(1,len(processlines)):     rowtext = processlines[row].strip()     rowelements = sep.split(rowtext)     try:         rss = float(rowelements[0]) * 1024     except:         rss = 0 # ignore...     rsstotal += rss  # process vm_stat vmlines = vm.split('\n') sep = re.compile(':[\s]+') vmstats = {} for row in range(1,len(vmlines)-2):     rowtext = vmlines[row].strip()     rowelements = sep.split(rowtext)     vmstats[(rowelements[0])] = int(rowelements[1].strip('\.')) * 4096  print 'wired memory:\t\t%d mb' % ( vmstats["pages wired down"]/1024/1024 ) print 'active memory:\t\t%d mb' % ( vmstats["pages active"]/1024/1024 ) print 'inactive memory:\t%d mb' % ( vmstats["pages inactive"]/1024/1024 ) print 'free memory:\t\t%d mb' % ( vmstats["pages free"]/1024/1024 ) print 'real mem total (ps):\t%.3f mb' % ( rsstotal/1024/1024 )   as you can see, you can just call vm_stat from the command line, though it counts in 4kb pages, hence the script to convert to mb.  the script also counts up the "real memory" usage of all running processes for comparison (this won't match any specific value(s) from overall memory stats, because memory is a complex beast).    here's an example of the output of the script on my system:  [user@host:~] % memreport.py wired memory:           1381 mb active memory:          3053 mb inactive memory:        727 mb free memory:            1619 mb real mem total (ps):    3402.828 mb   (very slightly adjusted to match the tab sizing on stackexchange ;)

that's pretty normal to see only the files for windows, when you are mounting the iso image on a windows!  even if you have inserted a mac os installation dvd (physical) into tray and openned it in a windows machine, you would have seen only the windows files and not the mac files. 
mdfind seems to ignore a lot of hidden files
the launchpad.app is located in your /application folder.  you can either   navigate with the finder to your /application folder and drag it to your dock search launchpad.app in spotlight and cmd+click the app
there is an application dockspaces that allows you to switch between different sets of applications in your dock (and i think different desktops but i don't use the desktop at all so i don't know if this does what you want) 
i haven't got my ipod touch with me but this works on the iphone if you go to settings -> general -> auto-lock and set it to never
nope
   how does the facebook app access sms data?   if by sms data you mean your texts   facebook cannot access your texts or imessages facebook cannot send texts or imessages facebook cannot see who you are texting or messaging   if by sms data you mean your cellular e/3g/4g/lte connection   you can disable this by going to settings -> cellular and switching facebook to the off (left) position. this is standard on all cellular phones      somehow, downloading the facebook app grants facebook access to sms data via imessages (if you use an iphone).    see above responses      what other data is facebook able to access on smartphones as soon as you download the fb app?    facebook cannot access your contacts, photos, calendars, reminders, location, camera, microphone without requesting access facebook can see which apps you have installed if the app is making its presence known facebook can access the time, the device settings, the internet  
you can use keyremap4macbook with a private.xml such as this:  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;disable ⌘e&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;disablecmde&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __keytokey__       keycode::e, vk_command | modifierflag::none,       keycode::vk_none     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt;  
boot the mac from a known-good local os.  you can install an os on to usb drives (hdd, ssd, flash) or even set up a local net boot server, but you'll need to get logs of how far into the boot process the computer gets to diagnose what subsystem is failing.  a hardware technician might remove all of the components that are not needed to boot the system and ensure that the ram and logic board are working, but i wouldn't recommend starting hardware diagnosis before you've finished the software analysis and brought a known good os of a proper version for your mac to the suspect hardware. 
the only reason i can see for sharing an apple id is to share purchases
if you're using the lion's built-in encryption, the answer is yes
⌘← can be assigned to \eoh and ⌘→ to \eof
there are many threads (on other forums) asking about the title wrapping, but i'm afraid it isn't possible
in order to uninstall itunes, you need to delete (drag to the trash) a lot of items:   the application's icon
remote buddy will allow you do to this (plus a whole lot more if you wish)
the whole imessage system is entirely proprietary, and there are no 3rd party clients available to use instead of the official ones, on either ios or osx
eventually, i gave the same answers but left the backup email blank
on your iphone, you have a 6 digit code, replacing the prior 4 digit code.  on your ipad, you have an alphanumeric password, which just happens to consist of just 6 digits
i'm with @tetsujin on this one
i figured out that i can't get the name of the show to come up in ipad's show list
not currently
the only way i could convince mail to show me the screen where i could change the account type was to put in a bogus non-gmail email address (literally the string bogus)
you can connect the ipad directly to your stereo using bluetooth
after you open the show fonts window, you can press ctrl+f6 to bring focus to the floating fonts window
building off of cksum's answer, if you can get ahold of the mask, overlay and shadow images at high enough resolution (@2x images are still only about 140px square,) and you're comfortable with the command line/shell scripting, you can use imagemagick, a nice command line image processor, to actually mask and compose the icon.  once you've installed imagemagick, (http://www.imagemagick.org) [they have installation instructions here] you should be able to process your image with the mask, overlay and shadow:  convert yourimage.png overlay.png -composite yourimage_overlay.png convert yourimage_overlay.png mask.png -alpha off -compose copyopacity -composite yourimage2.png convert shadow.png yourimage2.png -composite yourimage_largest.png convert yourimage_largest.png -geometry 512 icon512.png convert yourimage_largest.png -geometry 256 icon256.png   this assumes that your_image is large and square (1024x1024) and that the mask.png, overlay.png and shadow.png are the same size.  ideally, you wouldn't just resample the largest icon down to get the smaller versions, but you could instead use normal icon making software (e.g
search with google is a service provided by safari and has nothing to do with terminal.  google chrome should provide its own service for this feature
in the end i created the following .plist file
this was due to using synergy - when i plug my mouse in directly, it works as expected. 
go to system preferences, select language &amp; text, then the text tab, and deselect the box for that option.   or you can disable the feature completely by deselecting the box at the top. 
assuming you are running os x mavericks you have to open system preferences, click keyboard, then click text, if you are looking for the settings shown in the link you provided
you need to run this command with root privileges
on a high level, it's like an automatic transmission - when you press the gas gently, the throttle increases but when you stomp on the accelerator pedal the engine downshifts the transmission to increase the mechanical advantage.  you can influence switching to the powerful gpu by hitting the api with significant work and expect the "transmission" to dispatch that load to the non-integrated gpu.  the documentation on the api are all in xcode (and online too, but i prefer using search on xcode to hunt for a document).  i would start with:   xcdoc://?url=developer.apple.com/library/etc/redirect/xcode/mac/1153/technotes/tn2335/_index.html (online web link of the same article)   those links cover the mac pro and the "what you should know when using opencl" section contains a helpful note that wwdc 2013 session 508: working with opencl describes how to switch between two gpus in a mac portable using power considerations. 
there is a commandline app called softwareupdate that you have to run as root
there are three things to a "file" on posix filesystems:   the set of data blocks - the file's actual contents. the inode, which is a structure that holds the list of said blocks, and some metadata (size, ownership, permissions, link count, and some others). one or more directory entries, which contain a name and an inode number (and other things)   what you see when you run ls or in file browsers are the directory entries, organized in a tree of directories and files
one of the best apps i've found is ichm
in my experience apple stores won't really do that kind of work, you may be better off taking it to an authorised service centre for that kind of thing.  you can use activity monitor (found in utilities folder) to monitor disk activity
i've experienced this problem before, and i managed to get back two-page functionality by switching ibooks to full screen mode
a new mini is most likely 'enough' computer, but you also have options as to which os you run on it
the command "arp -an" will list all the mac addresses and ip addresses of all the devices seen on the local network.  once you have the mac address, you can look it up to determine the manufacturer of the device, which might give you a clue as to which one of your toys is talking to your machine
i solved this by creating a separate iphoto library and storing that library within a password-protected encrypted sparse image
apple has on their website the latest versions all of their legal documents on their website: http://www.apple.com/legal/
unfortunately you can't, ios 6 requires at least an 4th generation ipod touch (as noted in the system requirements (right hand side) of apples update overview). 
check this thread out http://askubuntu.com/questions/994/can-i-sync-with-my-iphone-4-and-ipad  otherwise you might ask directly on askubuntu
if you right click the iphone in the list on the left there should be an option to transfer purchases
&#x2325;+&#x2318;+m actually minimizes all windows of a current application, not just the current focused window (unless of course, the application you have running only has one non-minimized window.)  the easiest way to hide all active applications is to select the finder/desktop, and then "hide others." the keyboard shortcut is &#x2325;+&#x2318;+h.  you can also simply hold &#x2325; and &#x2318; and click on the desktop, or finder on the dock, or of course, simply use expose and hit f11 (or whatever you've rebound hide-all to.) 
i'm pretty sure apple had a mouse for the apple ii line although i'm not sure if it overlapped with the lisa and mac.  the first lisa had its own operating system which used an early version of bill atkinson's quickdraw routines, had overlapping windows, pull down menus although if memory serves it had a document model more like opendoc than what the mac had a bit later.  after the mac came out in 1984 the lisa was rebranded "macintosh xl" and it used an early version of the macintosh os until it was phased out.  in short, the lisa was the bridge between the ideas that jobs, atkinson and others had seen at xerox parc and the mac.  here's an excellent history: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apple_lisa 
first the bad news, there is no simple 'un-rm'/un-delete and everything will be as it was before
writeroom is a pretty awesome text editor in general, and will let you do this through its built in custom themes feature. 
you can use the sips command to pad any jpeg or bmp image to a specified size, with a specified colour
i am 100% sure there is no way to see how long the the backup takes just the size of the backup and how much portion of the size it has already backed up like shown below.    the only time duration that time machine shows is when you are restoring from a backup and during the first time you set up time machine using a empty hard disk.  i just noticed that "open time machine preferences" shows a progress bar for the current backup operation
it's a while since i used mavericks but on os x 10.11.5 el capitan in the system preferences for mission control there's a hot corners button in the bottom left corner.  opening this i was able to assign the bottom left hot corner to 'mission control'
here's a script that takes the current time and makes it hhmm as you asked.  -- preserve the current text item delimiters so we can put them back set olddelims to applescript's text item delimiters  set right_now to current date set the_time to time string of right_now -- something like "4:20:56 pm" set am_pm to characters -2 thru -1 of the_time as string -- is it am or pm  set applescript's text item delimiters to ":" set the_hour to text item 1 of the_time as string -- in this example, "4" set the_minute to text item 2 of the_time as string -- in this example, "20"  if (am_pm is "pm") then     set the_hour to the_hour + 12 end if  if the_hour is "24" then     set the_hour to "12" end if -- that could have been more graceful but it's nice and obvious this way  if (count of the_hour) is 1 then -- padding with a zero if necessary     set the_hour to "0" &amp; the_hour end if  if (count of the_minute) is 1 then -- padding with a zero if necessary     set the_minute to "0" &amp; the_minute end if  set applescript's text item delimiters to "" set steves_string to the_hour &amp; the_minute as string -- putting the pieces together  set applescript's text item delimiters to olddelims -- cleaning up  return steves_string -- you would not need this line, but for testing it's nice   i am sure that this could be tightened up but i thought it was educational to see it step by step.  you could certainly pass in any time you wanted-- does not have to be "current date." (note that current date includes the time too
no, i have suffered some game center outages in the past, but could not find a source directly from apple which stated so, not even the icloud status page.  the icloud system status page now lists the status for all apple internet services, including game center. 
app store is divided by countries it is available in and each country's app store is a separate entity
the best and easiest way, shoot a mail to the apple support team.  they will revert back to you asking a couple of personal information questions, and once they are convinced you are the rightful owner of the account, they can enable/unlock your account.

zenmap can absolutely provide netbios names (the names you are referring to)
you can navigate your backup drive in the finder
how does an iphone send imessages to ipad:   make sure imessage is set "on" on both devices on your iphone, go to contacts and find your friend's name to check whether or not you have his email address
i was going to chalk it up to the developer just being lazy and selecting the default value and tab-completing when creating their app
your question's wording is a bit unluckily.  there is no previous ipad with the same battery capacity
kind of
by default, no, there's no keyboard shortcut to activate finder.  keyboard maestro can do this though:   
by pure chance i found my answer through this post, which is about remapping shortcuts via the settings menu  how do i remove the &#39;quit&#39; action from an application on osx    you have to use cmd + shift + / to get to the input field! (probably similar for the non german speakers out there)  sandro 
on your mac, enable photo sharing in itunes
yes you can
afaik, you cannot delete the holiday calender on your ios device
you can try this dtrace one-liner:  sudo dtrace -n 'syscall::recvfrom:return { @[pid,execname] = sum(arg0); }'   let it run for a while, then hit control-c
no; ios does not provide any options or control for wallpaper positioning - you set the file and it does what it does. 
if you need it for an older mac, download it on that one
if you purchased the applecare extended warranty for your ipad before you broke it, you can get your ipad replaced for a fee of, i believe, us$60 from the apple store or an authorized apple dealer
turns out, there is a program called punto switcher that does exactly that.    it puts a global hook on keyboard events and triggers automatic input switch (which is configurable) as soon as it detects nonsense being typed

it is not possible to get a record with a single object specifier, but you can get a list:  tell application "safari"     {url, name} of tabs of windows end tell -- {{{"http://url1", "title 1"}, {"http://url2", "title 2"}}}   for a record, you can use a repeat loop:  set r to {} tell application "safari"     repeat with t in tabs of windows         set end of r to {|url|:url of t, |name|:name of t}     end repeat end tell r -- {{|url|:"http://url1", |name|:"title 1"}, {|url|:"http://url2", |name|:"title 2"}}  
so far as i know there isn't a nice automated way to provide the benefits of system restore as it is implemented on windows
try following in terminal to adjust the dock behavior.  defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.5   compliment that with killall dock to make it active.  the number at the end is in seconds (delay) so choose what it suits you.  to return to original settings use  defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier  
not possible
unfortunately what you're looking for is unavailable as of ios 5.1
this set up option will share your music with others on your local network.  settings for itunes sharing    if we are talking about standard folers (not itunes) but just any folder in finder.  right click on the folder  select      get info   in that window look all the way at the bottom, there is      small lock     open it (with your password)  now you can modify "others" as they show up in your list the access to this folder to      read only   . 
try this hint from apple support
there is a way, though a bit strange.  if you choose to delete the podcast/file, you will get a confirmation dialog with delete/cancel option

just drag and drop :)  sometimes it does not work so, you do a simple:   copy: copy to clipboard the icon you want to use select: select the icon you want to remove paste: paste it       
have you considered cloning your current hard drive? with a utility like carbon copy cloner (which you can use for free for 30 days, i think), and an external interface for your new hard drive (usb, firewire, etc.), you can clone--i.e
you can effectively turn off push notifications for a particular email account..
one way is to create a service that runs a shell command.  for this, open automator, create a new service, check "output replaces selected text", then add the action "run shell script"
this sure takes me back to my university days...  mutt has still got to be one of the best terminal-based mail clients out there
you might want to set yourself up a standard user account in system preferences
if i get it right, you want to monitor all file-system operations of your app when you launch it and when it's running ? rather than finding each and every byte that this program has ever written to your hard-drive
my solution is to just use a different quicklook generator
to not get that error, you need to make myshellscript.sh executable.  in a terminal, use the following command:  chmod u+x /path/to/file/myshellscript.sh   also, you should add a shebang to the top of the script.  example: #!/bin/bash  note: use the appropriate shebang for the shell you want to process your script.  if you do not want to make the script executable, although i can't see a reason one wouldn't want to, you can run it in applescript as in the following example:  do shell script "bash /path/to/file/myshellscript.sh"   note: if you want to use sh over bash, just substitute it in the command and the shebang. 
airplay sends mp3, aac and h.264 compressed data directly to receivers, thus a very high compression in some cases and very good for the rest.  apple'd developer documentation covers the basics as well as some tips for preparing content so that it streams/forwards well.  http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/audiovideo/conceptual/airplayguide/introduction/introduction.html  the decoding of the streams is done by a chip (and encoded as well - the same on ios as on os x) so you can see which devices support airplay and deduce which gpu and cpu families have the hardware to do this both rapidly and in the case of ios with low power usage.  this ios support matrix is very handy to see each ios version and the cpu/ram for various models even though it doesn't call out airplay support specifically. 
sorry for the self-answer, but i found a way to do it quickly using just the iphone and no third-party software.  in ios 4.3, do the following:   open camera.app click the photo thumbnail to view the photo library click camera roll to view all photos there's a capsule button at the top that says 'all|photos|videos'
yes
there are a few ways to get a single large dv file imported from tape, depending on whether your constraint is budget or time:  1) quicktime pro 7 has a recording mode that can see dv devices
well i found a way but it's not easy!   locate the file in the media type > voice memos folder. double-click one of the audiobook tracks to play it in itunes. right-click the play-bar at the top of itunes and choose get info and you can change that track back to an audiobook.      you could do this for every track but in my case i found that doing this revealed all of the audiobook tracks under my music even though they were still tagged as voice memos
from what i can tell, wired memory belongs to the kernel, the innermost core of mac os x
there are three categories: top free, top paid, and top grossing.  in the top free category, the apps with the most downloads that have a price of $0 make the list.  in the top paid category, the apps with the most downloads that have a price greater than $0 make the list.  the top grossing category lists the apps with the highest total revenue (that is, price * quantity sold + revenue from in-app purchases)
if you hold command and quickly tap tab you will cycle between your two most recently used applications without bringing up the heads up display.  if you want to use a third party app witch has options to ignore minimized windows
this is included by apple in the latest ios
it's obvious apple has a build in procedure to block this kind of actions
in this article jonathan rentzsch creates a new service because he wants "search with google" to work in chrome (his default browser) but a side benefit of following his tutorial is that your search should open in a new tab
as others already let clear, apple doesn't offer any good solution for those issues
the 'compression type' (e.g
 to find .bash_profile enter in terminal.app:  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles yes  the .bash_profile should be in your home file folder. open this file with some editor, like textedit and paste it there:    path=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin    export path   path=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:"$path"   path=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:"$path"  close and save it, then restart the console. tap it, to hide hidden files:  defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles no

to assign the script to a keyboard shortcut, you can assign it an automator service.  open automator.app and choose service, and set the "recieves text" at the top to no input.  drag in the "run applescript" action from the library
the built-in airprint doesn't allow this sort of functionality as of ios 4, but if you get the hp eprint app, you should be able to do b&amp;w printing and manage other settings

it seems you can use live meeting web access to join, but not host meetings.  http://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2010/05/25/how-to-use-your-mac-with-sharepoint-online-and-live-meeting.aspx 
such information on os x is instead located in man manpages, which is also available online here:     manual page sections      the manual is divided into sections
the short answer: notch and peak filters
adobe reader for mac is my best bet.  you can also try foxit. 
your iphoto library (by default) is located in ~/pictures as a package (.photolibrary). your itunes library (by default) is located in ~/music as a folder.  copying the entire library will copy all the data (unless you are using referenced media)

the short answer is no
it will still take 30 clicks, one for each link, but…  remember that  cmd ⌘  on mac is usually equivalent to  ctrl ⌃  on windows.   cmd ⌘  click will open a link in a new a tab behind the current one, if you click a link.   cmd ⌘   shift ⇧  click will open the new tab &amp; bring it to the front.  these are the default settings [iirc] but they can be changed in prefs…    edit: sorry, i only just realised you said chrome. it does follow the same behaviour, though i can't find anywhere to actually change it. 
edit: changed my answer
you've said in your question that you've been trying to erase the flash drive; not format it

the blinking is a for of post (power on self test) and can certainly help diagnose the issue.  as most people are saying it is most likely a ram issue.  the following documents can help diagnose post messages and various issues related to your laptop during the boot process:   intel-based mac: startup sequence and error codes, symbols intel-based mac power on self test ram error codes your mac won't start up in mac os x (mac os x 10.3.9 or earlier)  
the macbook air came pre-installed with mac os x 10.6 snow leopard, which was available with a physical installation media only.  here is what i would do in your situation:  parts replacement (usb key installation media): contact apple and ask if they still replace the missing parts (costs will apply, but i do not know how much).    order a replacement disc: ask, if they still sell replacement discs
http://blog.ghostinthemachines.com/2010/01/19/mac-os-x-fork-resource-temporarily-unavailable/ talks about this issue in great detail.  when you do sudo launchctl limit maxproc, you're viewing or changing the system-wide launchd limits.  when you do launchctl limit maxproc, you're viewing or changing the launchd limits for your user.  one thing to keep in mind is this:     the root user can increase the hard limits of the system-wide launchd,   without a reboot
there is an apple discussion here that describes the same problem, and refers to this osx dialy link on how to correctly refresh launchpad, and fix a corrupted launchpad.  the short version of the answer is:     basically i used terminal to kill the dock with the command "killall dock"      then i had to delete the dock database file located in "home folder/library/application support/dock" you get to your library folder by holding down the option key while clicking "go" in finder.      then kill the dock again with the terminal command "killall dock"
you should be able to use applications/utilities/grab.app for this kind of thing, it offers more kinds of capture including timed. 
the easist way would be to copy the files in "c:\users\thomas\music\itunes" to the same folder in your new user account
yes, the content on icloud is separate from any particular device (except backup) and can be accessed from a different device regardless of what happened to the original
in order for a mac to create a local wi-fi network, it needs to have a wired internet source
ok, i found one solution that works great.  since the connection between the computers was originally wired with a router, i plugged them both into the router.  then i removed the default gateway settings from the wired connection
after going to the wallpaper section from within settings.app and choosing an image;   on the ipad, there are 'set lock screen', 'set home screen', and 'set both' buttons on the top of the screen while previewing the image. on the iphone, a menu pops up asking whether you'd like it on the lock screen or home screen, or both, after tapping 'set'.     
after some more searching, i found a command-line answer:  codesign -d --entitlements - /applications/whatever.app/   this will print out an xml plist with values like:  &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.app-sandbox&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt;   if anyone knows an easier/nicer way, though, i'd love to hear it. 
time machine shouldn't be backing up the trash folder(s) under normal circumstances.  in any case, you might want to use terminal command tmutil delete command to delete the offending files.  tmutil delete /volumes/disk/backups.backupdb/host/date/macintosh hd/.trashes  
from synergy configuration file format  screensaversync = {true|false}   if set to false then synergy won't synchronize screen savers
frustratingly, apple bluetooth peripherals can only be paired with one mac
i'm afraid no feature like that exists.  however, with quicktime pro, you can fairly easily cut out clips of a movie to save for later
i am sorry to say that i am unaware of any apps (jailbroken or otherwise) that add keyboard navigation to the ipad.  according to gigaom, the following shortcuts do work:   ⌘c copy selected text ⌘x cut selected text ⌘v paste ⌘z undo ⌘shiftz redo ⌘↑ go to top of document ⌘↓ go to bottom of document ⌘← go to start of line ⌘→ go to end of line ⌘⌫ delete to end of line ⌥⌫ delete previous word f1 make screen dimmer f2 make screen brighter f7 skip back one song f8 play or pause music f9 skip forward one song f10 mute volume f11 decrease volume f12 increase volume  ⏏ show or hide onscreen keyboard

i usually use scripts like this instead of automator services:  try     set old to the clipboard as record end try tell application "system events" to keystroke "c" using command down do shell script "export lc_ctype=utf-8; pbpaste | /usr/local/bin/pygmentize -g -f rtf | pbcopy" tell application "system events" to keystroke "v" using command down delay 0.05 try     set the clipboard to old end try    if the clipboard is empty, trying to get it results in an error. pbpaste and pbcopy use ascii if the locale variables are unset
intel is making big improvements in the integrated graphics performances.  they are actually taking a portion of the nvida market in doing that.  to intel, the nvidia is just a parasite, so if they can do better with the igpu performance, ppl wont need it.  intel will be introducing next gen cpu with some powerful igpu in 2015.  there is no official benchmarking for the iris pro vs g750 but as usual the performance is highly game type dependent.  as you have discovered for the league of legends it looks like the iris is actually doing better then g750.  there are some games where the g750 is doing better, like startcraf2 and heaven.  see this report for more. 
tap, and hold the image; then choose "copy," open a new browser window, and paste into the address bar. 
external account settings can be found under settings-> mail, contacts, calendars-> fetch new data. configure the frequency of synchronization on the bottom of the screen
okay, i'm going to chime in.  firstly, let's look at your first question: why does os x warn a user before they launch it for the very first time?  os x had instituted the added precaution for one important reason: so that apps wouldn't seemingly launch on their own
under your system preferences > display, you've got this   just drag the white bar to the other screen to set it as the main screen.  you might have to do that every time you reboot / reconnect the external screen. 
you're probably better off running in bootcamp.  this will give you near native performance and allow you to run the game without a lot of the overhead a virtual machine will give be giving you. 
you might use a private.xml like this with keyremap4macbook:  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;devicevendordef&gt;     &lt;vendorname&gt;apple&lt;/vendorname&gt;     &lt;vendorid&gt;0x05f3&lt;/vendorid&gt;

here is the one-liner i found to create a ramdisk:  diskutil erasevolume hfs+ "ramdisk" `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://1165430`   it is actually two commands; if you run them individually, you get:  $ hdiutil attach -nomount ram://1165430 /dev/disk4                $ diskutil erasevolume hfs+ "ramdisk" /dev/disk4 started erase on disk4 unmounting disk erasing initialized /dev/rdisk4 as a 569 mb hfs plus volume mounting disk finished erase on disk4 ramdisk   the first command creates a block storage device in ram, and the second command formats it with the standard os x filesystem.  if you run df to see how much free space is on your disks, you'll get:  $ df filesystem                        512-blocks      used available capacity  mounted on /dev/disk0s2                       974509344 435640768 538356576    45%    / .... /dev/disk4                           1165424     27376   1138048     3%    /volumes/ramdisk   note how it shows that the ram disk is using 1165424 '512-blocks' (which, if you run df -h, for human readable output, you'll see is '569 mi').  so, the answer is, change the number you specify in the first command, which specified how large the disk is in 512 byte blocks

thanks to @austin and others, i finally solved the problem! i thought damn it, this is a unix box, i should be able to find out what's going on! i found another snow leopard machine at work which never had internet sharing turned on and in a terminal i ran:     touch now &amp;&amp; sudo find -x / -newer now  and i got a short list of files that always show up (spotlight indexes, log files in /private/log and if you are using file vault a bunch of encrypted sparse bundles  ...)  then i enabled internet sharing and this time i ran:     sudo find -x / -newer now  obviously without the "touch now"

if you have a verified phone number and have set up the ability to verify devices using sms verification code, you can use this method
preview.app, the default os x pdf viewer, sees underscores and allows you to search them fine.  you can search for words or phrases with underscores by using the underscore in the search box, as below:   
echo 'export path=/my/path:$path' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile should do the trick!  if you used echo 'export path=/my/path:$path' &gt; ~/.bash_profile, or any such variation, you would be overwriting the contents of your profile! 
given that the results of “all my files” smart search respects spotlight preference pane's search results, if you uncheck or drag music below pictures, that order is respected.  i infer this, because i have music disabled in spotlight and i don't see music in my “all my files”.  i see pdf, images, spreadsheets, developer and documents (in that order)
i would suggest   find 
short answer  i think the problem here is that a lot of homebrew packages don't include x11 support by default if there is a more relevant (i.e
goto terminal (next to the apple icon) -> preferences -> profiles  then select homebrew and click "default" you can find it down there in the section you select homebrew.  if you like homebrew you might like iterm2
the 15" and 13" macbook pros are vastly different machines

chealion answered this on superuser.  i won't copy and paste his answer here, as he got the credit not me.  but basically, what you could do is (quoted from chealion's answer) :      a second method of arranging the windows so you can see them (if for some reason they're staying off screen) is to change to the   application that owns the window in question, hold the option key down   and choose "arrange in front" from the window menu
if you are asking about pasting into windows of the terminal application (which is not the same as console application; neither of which are the same as the actual “console”), then you can uncheck the escape non-ascii input option in the “settings set” that you are using.  with terminal active, open the preferences: press ⌘ + , or select the terminal > preferences… menu item.   click the settings icon in the tool bar of the preferences window. from the list on the left side of the preferences window, select the “settings set” that you want to modify.  the settings set of the previously active terminal window will be initially selected. click the advanced tab. uncheck the escape non-ascii input checkbox.    
a support request was filed and bare bones responded quickly.  textwrangler sets the file type (com.apple.finderinfo; file icon) when it determines that the file name cannot be used to determine that it is a text file

depending on how your system prefs are set,  f3  will do a variety of window-juggling tasks…  if prefs > keyboard > keyboard is set to default, with "use all f1, f2…" unchecked then they will work as stated, if it's checked you will need to add the  fn  key to each of these commands.   f3  will toggle mission control - all windows of all apps &amp; desktops spread out so you can see them.   cmd ⌘   f3  will toggle desktop view only.   ctrl ⌃   f3  will show all windows of only the frontmost app *[this is likely to be the closest to what you need.]   shift ⇧   f3  will do the same as just  f3  … only really really slowly [for presentations etc]   opt ⌥   f3  will bring up mission control prefs, where you can tweak other behaviour.  you can also go directly to a given tab by right-clicking the app icon in the dock, though it only shows the frontmost tab's title for each window. 
you can use the ecm tools created by neill corlett, the creator of ecm

using custom paper sizes actually falls to the printer driver, via the page setup window.   in pages, select "page setup" from the file menu. click the "paper size" menu, and way at the bottom, select "manage custom sizes". this will present a window where you can define your page dimensions, give it a name, and save it for future use in the page setup window
you have four options.   turn on do not disturb and lock the screen (or configure it to block all calls whether the screen is locked or not on ios 7) place the phone in airplane mode - this disables the cellular data, sms and cellular calls as well as wifi

i've set a stylesheet in safari and these are the changes that occurred in safari's plist:  userstylesheetenabled = 1; userstylesheetlocationurlstring = "~/desktop/dsa.css"; webkituserstylesheetenabledpreferencekey = 1; webkituserstylesheetlocationpreferencekey = "~/desktop/dsa.css";   your command line would be:  defaults write com.apple.safari userstylesheetenabled 1 &amp;&amp; defaults write com.apple.safari userstylesheetlocationurlstring "/path/to/css" &amp;&amp; defaults write com.apple.safari webkituserstylesheetenabledpreferencekey 1 &amp;&amp; defaults write com.apple.safari webkituserstylesheetlocationpreferencekey "/path/to/css"  
for some applications you can use applescript:  screencapture -l$(osascript -e 'tell app "safari" to id of window 1') test.png   it doesn't work with chrome though.  the ids are also shown in quartz debug (available from developer.apple.com/downloads) if you run defaults write com.apple.quartzdebug quartzdebugprivateinterface -bool true.   
i've just changed the login shell and left terminal's settings unchanged.   set the shells open with setting back to the default login shell in terminal's preferences add /opt/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells chsh -s /opt/local/bin/bash open a new tab and check echo $bash_version

in reproducing this to investigate, i notice that i have my keychain configured to “confirm before allowing access.” so when i perform the find-internet-password locally with the -g flag, i get a dialog box stating security wants to use your confidential information stored in “smtp.gmail.com” in your keychain. if i click “allow” then it works, if i click “deny” it fails similarly to the ssh case, with a return code of 51.   when i try the command remotely via ssh, the -g immediately results in failure, with the status of 36 that you are reporting.  i suspect that this is because, when you ssh in, there is no way for the system to pop up a dialog box allowing you to confirm that you want to allow the security command to access this information.  i was able to get the command to work while connected by ssh by first clicking the “always allow” option when running the command locally

if the problem you're experiencing is that the ipad connections trigger a new ipad activation dialog, you can turn this off by typing this terminal command when itunes is not running:  defaults write com.apple.itunes storeactivationmode -integer 1   you can turn on the new ipad activation dialog with this command:  defaults delete com.apple.itunes storeactivationmode   remember, itunes cannot be running when either of these commands is run.

yes that works fine, just know that you need to pay full retail for it so you are not beholden to any carrier to pay for the rest of it
i not sure why it does it every time, but the 'optimising' is basically shrinking their dimensions to the ipod screen size, thus saving space on the ipod.  i would therefore assume that it does it every time as it doesn't save the 'optimised' ones in order to save space on the computer. 
take the script that you created:  #!/bin/bash  echo "plugin l2tp.ppp"&gt;&gt;/etc/ppp/options  echo "l2tpnoipsec"&gt;&gt;/etc/ppp/options   save it in your home directory, or a 'scripts' directory inside your home directory, as l2tp.sh

on a mac: drag the files into itunes with the option key down and the files won't be copied to your itunes media folder.  that's the exact result you like.  there is also the option to change it so you don't have to press option key:    you can press option key after changing that setting to copy it on purpose
you can find it in the build inspector under the action tab.

yes, you can achieve your desired behavior without disabling messages on your mac.  if you turn off notifications for messages from within system preferences, you will still receive the messages, but will not be notified that they came in.  you can turn notifications off on the following screen
i also use screenflow, but there are also a few standalone apps for that like keycastr and mouseposé. 
if you have the optional command line tools that xcode will install for you, codesign is the tool of choice.  using the terminal app:  $ codesign --display -vv /applications/garageband.app/ executable=/applications/garageband.app/contents/macos/garageband identifier=com.apple.garageband format=bundle with mach-o thin (i386) codedirectory v=20100 size=24489 flags=0x200(kill) hashes=1218+3 location=embedded signature size=4169 authority=apple mac os application signing authority=apple worldwide developer relations certification authority authority=apple root ca info.plist entries=27 sealed resources rules=14 files=2021 internal requirements count=2 size=500   and a non-apple signed app..  $ codesign --display -vv /applications/iterm.app/ [snip] authority=developer id application: george nachman  
sure it works but you have to create, clone/tm-restore and erase various volumes:  i assume your internal disk is disk0 containing disks0s2 as your internal start volume and your external disk is disk1 with disk1s2 as your time machine volume.  without loosing your tm backup:  this only works if the sum of used space on your tm-volume and used space on your main volume is smaller than ~ 500 gb (to leave some recommended free space on the interim main volume disk1s3)

i created a folder action script in applescript, that might do just what you want. copy and paste it into a new applescript, and save it as an application (without a starting dialogue!) into "/library/scripts/folder action scripts/". you can then attach it to any folder (most likely your ~/downloads/ folder ) by right clicking on the folder and selecting "configure folder actions" from the services drop-out menu
well, apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time, as for a lithium-based battery, it's important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally
with the release of mac os 10.4, launchd was chosen to supersede cron in mac os
you can easily run as another user with sudo -u like so:  #!/bin/sh  uzer=jsmith  sudo -u "$uzer" /path/to/program/you/want/to/run  exit 0   just change 'jsmith' to the appropriate short user name, and then save that as a script somewhere, and call from /library/launchdaemons  remember that all files in /library/launchdaemons must be owned by root to be run.  (i think this is what bmike was suggesting)  another option  however, i wrote up a howto for making auto-login more secure:  terminally geeky: use automatic login more securely  the executive summary is this:   turn on automatic login put this launchd plist in ~/library/launchagents reboot   what it does:  as soon as you login, launchd will throw you back to the login screen using:  "/system/library/coreservices/menu extras/user.menu/contents/resources/cgsession" -suspend   note that is all one long line.  considering that someone with physical access to your computer has a lot of potential exploits, i consider this relatively safe, but of course everyone has to make their own determination
i turned the phone off, on, and re-synched with itunes and now it works. 
once an rss feed is added to mail, you cannot see the url it retrieves anywhere within mail :(  there does not appear to be any way you can read the configuration using applescript, looking at the dictionary, the rss feeds are not accessible either as a distinct entity type or as a mailbox type.  the only place i can find this information is in ~/library/mail/rss  each feed is a folder with an .rssmbox extension and inside the folder, the info.plist contains the url of the feed.  edit: change reponse re: applescript after further investigation  
your full hard drive could be a reason
unfortunately this does not work out of the box
the second answer concerns mac os x (as i haven't specified the system when asking the question)
you want to change line 92 of the xml version of  /system/library/coreservices/menu extras/battery.menu/contents/resources/english.lproj/localizable.strings:   make a copy of the strings file:  cp /system/library/coreservices/menu\ extras/battery.menu/contents/resources/\ english.lproj/localizable.strings ~/desktop  convert the binary strings file to xml:  plutil -convert xml1 ~/desktop/localizable.strings  edit line 92 (yosemite) of the file now on the desktop with your favourite text editor:   convert the xml strings file back to binary:  plutil -convert binary1 ~/desktop/localizable.strings  back up your existing file! if you mess up, this will let you reverse your changes by removing -bak from the file name.  sudo mv /system/library/coreservices/menu\ extras/battery.menu/contents/resources/\ english.lproj/localizable.strings /system/library/coreservices/menu\ extras/\ battery.menu/contents/resources/english.lproj/localizable.strings-bak  overwrite the old file with the new:  sudo mv ~/desktop/localizable.strings /system/library/coreservices/menu\ extras/\ battery.menu/contents/resources/english.lproj/      result:

to disable the kext signing security setting:  sudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1   after changing this setting you need to restart the computer to have os x recognize it.  it is important to note that the kext-signing setting is global, if you disable it you should be careful to only install system drivers from sources that you trust.  to reenable again use:  sudo nvram -d boot-args  
the apple broadcom bcm94331cd adapter will add 802.11 a/b/g/n with bluetooth 4.0 to an older mac pro, while the apple broadcom bcm94360cd adapter will enable 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac support (the primary difference between the two adapters being 802.11 ac).  you can easily diy by finding suitable parts on ebay or amazon and following instructions on forum sites such as macrumors and elsewhere.  if you're running yosemite and want to take advantage of continuity, you'd then just need to buy a third-party bluetooth 4.0 usb dongle that utilizes the broadcom bcm20702 chipset (e.g

apparently the "recently deleted"-feature in ios8 is broken. photos you've deleted don't disappear after 30 days, they're just hidden on your device. the storage being used isn't "phantom usage", since the photos are still safely stored. the easiest short term solution is to set back your date on the phone month by month (until the release of ios8), and your deleted photos will reappear in the "recently deleted"-folder

there are a few methods to shutdown without confirmation (this will not remove the confirmation from the original method):   in terminal: shutdown -h now, but this force quits all applications make an applescript and save it as 'application,' save it somewhere easily accessible, but not prone to accidental clicks:    on run   do shell script "shutdown -h now" end run   the shortcut control-⌥ option-⌘ cmd-⏏ eject clicking shutdown with ⌥ alt / ⌥ option held down (as you said) if using alfred, you can summon the alfred window and start typing "shut down" or "restart" and then pressing enter
restarting the router and cable modem had no effect, however, telling the airport extreme to use a separate ssid for n-connections has made a huge difference.  at the moment i cannot tell if this is due to other variables (such as local loop usage, etc), but it appears to have "solved" the problem
yes, you can buy third party ram

according to similar questions in stackoverflow and superuser ukelele is the tool to edit and eliminate dead keys. 
you could try modifying the permissions on the saved state folder so it cannot be written to.  take preview.app for example.  open terminal.app from the utilities folder under applications and enter:  sudo chmod 440 ~/library/saved application state/com.apple.preview.savedstate/  so you will want to look in the your "~/library/saved application state" folder for the path to the iterm saved state and modify the command above accordingly.

from the apple support database article regarding network connection priority:     if you connect to the internet or a network in several different ways   (using wi-fi or ethernet, for example), you can change the order of   the network port configurations your computer tries when connecting to   the internet or network.      if there are multiple active network port configurations when you try   to connect, os x tries the one at the top of the list first, and then   tries the other port configurations in descending order.   in that support article it is also described how you can change the priority order of network connections in system preferences.

i don't know how to get the phone to sync with a different group than my contacts, or to sync all the contacts, but as long as you aren't using my contacts for filing now, then you can have every contact in two groups - "my contacts" for syncing and your chosen group for filing and organization.  you can do this without destroying the rest of your sorting scheme by selecting all contacts in each group in google contacts, opening the groups menu, clicking the checkbox next to my contacts until it shows up as a solid check mark (not a slash), and then clicking "apply" in the same menu
here is the procedure i recommend, for those who are comfortable with the command-line and with homebrew:  install homebrew.  run the following on the command line (in terminal):  brew install macvim --with-override-system-vim brew linkapps   edit your shell startup files to ensure that /usr/local/bin comes first in your $path.  if you use vim as $visual or $editor, add `export visual='mvim -f' to your environment (details).  check that you installed everything correctly by running  brew doctor   now, you can run the graphical macvim on a file by running mvim foo.txt from the command-line

my guess would be that there is a login item for the dead server
according to topher kessler article on cnet, you can add an entry to /etc/fstab, specifying the noauto option.  such an entry might look like this:  uuid=791e37b4-82a3-37e7-9f15-3c39359126b4   none  hfs  rw,noauto   the uuid may be obtained by looking for the volume uuid line that is printed when you run diskutil info /volumes/volume name. 
basically you have to delete the linux partitions (disk0s4 and disk0s5) and then expand your corestorage volume (macintosh hd) to the full size.   boot to internet recovery mode by pressing altcmdr while booting open terminal in the menubar -> utilities enter diskutil list and diskutil cs list to get the partition and the corestorage listing. now unmount all disks except the os x base system (~1.3 gb) and its accompanying volumes (eleven really small sized volumes)

you can do this with karabiner with a private.xml such as this:  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;~ to ⌘⇥&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.tildetocommandtab&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __keytokey__       keycode::backquote, vk_shift | modifierflag::none,       keycode::tab | modifierflag::command_l     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt;   this will effectively replace command with shift and tab with tilde, so that holding shift and pressing tilde twice will switch to the third app rather than back to the first. 
shift-space  space goes down a page, and shift-space is the opposite, scrolling up one page. 
that approach is more of a straight-to-hard approach

the following command will give you the os x version installed on  volumename:  defaults read /volumes/volumename/system/library/coreservices/systemversion productversion   to get a list of each volume's os version, you need a simple script that will get a list of volumes, search each one for the systemversion.plist, and report any that are found.  i found a script on on mac os x hints, by hal itosis, that does just that (reposted below for convenience).  #!/bin/bash - path=/bin:/usr/bin export path ifs=$'\n'  vlist=$(df -l | sed '1d;s:^.*%[[:space:]]*::') spath=$(find -x /volumes -maxdepth 1 -type l -not -inum 2) pfile=/system/library/coreservices/systemversion  sysvers () {    if [ -e "${1}${pfile}.plist" ]; then       n="$1"; if [ "$1" = '/' ]; then n="$spath"; fi       x=`defaults read ${1}${pfile} productversion`       b=`defaults read ${1}${pfile} productbuildversion`       printf '%-16s %-8s %-8s\n' "${n##/*/}" "$x" "($b)"    fi }  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then for v in $vlist; do sysvers "$v"; done else while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do sysvers "$1"; shift; done; fi exit

i have not had success with "reporting a problem," because my requests have been ignored in three different cases now.  here's my workflow that has worked for me each time:   purchase app find something wrong with app report a problem (it will be ignored, but do this just to say you did) contact credit card provider and dispute the charge with your reasons (mine are usually "software did not work at all" or "as promised") wait 3-5 business days credit card provider resolves dispute, issues refund apple disables appleid due to "security risk" of account access contact apple support by emailing or asking for a phone call wait 1-2 business days for response kindly explain what happened, they respond by following a walkthrough of re-enabling your account after verifying security questions

yes, you will be able to partition later
you'll want a tool that lets you script the changes so you can roll them in and out or perhaps get fancy and script it based on the detected network connection interface.  i would start by evaluating little snitch to see if it fits your needs or at least can give you a leg up on the processes that are connecting in case you care to just control them
okay, so i think i've solved the problem and thought i'd post this up just in case anyone runs into similar issues..
you can do this with an automator service.  create the service:   open automator and select service or file > new > service if automator is already open. set service receives selected to files or folders and in to finder. add a run shell script action, setting shell: to /bin/bash and pass input: to as arguments and add the following code:     for f in "$@"; do     open -a 'visual studio code' "$f" done      save the service as open in visual studio code.      close automator.   you can now select files and or folders in finder and then control-click (right-click) on them and select open in visual studio code from the services context menu.  note: i tested this with visual studio code but not with brackets as i don't have it installed
you can use xattr to write various metadata related to the "new" tags in mavericks

if you want to avoid the default behaviour, which is a reasonable setting for a computer that allows multiple accounts, including guest accounts, you can do the following in keychain access:   change the keychain password for each really sensitive item you have in there:   select a relevant item in keychain access get information on the item with the get info menu select the access control tab mark the ask for keychain password checkbox    that should allow for the most sensitive passwords (or all of them, if you apply it to all of them) to require your password to be provided every time they are about to be used, and hence won't show in safari's saved passwords unless that keychain password is provided.  another option is creating a new keychain, different from the login keychain, with a different passwords, and move the items from the login keychain
i would install homebrew with  ruby &lt;(curl -fsskl raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go) brew install macvim --override-system-vim   it has ruby and python support and will effectively replace the original vim without actually deleting it (because the homebrew one will be in /usr/local)

since mail does not have a predefined filter (in smart mailboxes) to get the 50 last received messages, i can imagine you could achieve something like this in an applescript.  the applescript should:   get every message in inbox sort the list by date select all but the most recent 50 ones delete selected   then, create a mail rule that will be triggered whenever a new email arrives (e.g

 cmd ⌘   h  is the system-wide shortcut for "hide frontmost app"  to try tie a new shortcut to that, you could maybe use automator to add a service - but i still don't know how you would persuade it to override the existing system default.  this works as a service if you use a non-system key, but not with  cmd ⌘   h   on run {input, parameters}      set newhiddenvisiblesstate to "yes"     try         set oldhiddenvisiblesstate to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles"         if oldhiddenvisiblesstate is in {"1", "yes"} then             set newhiddenvisiblesstate to "no"         end if     end try     do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles " &amp; newhiddenvisiblesstate       tell application "finder"         set thewindows to every finder window         repeat with i from 1 to number of items in thewindows             set this_item to item i of thewindows             set theview to current view of this_item             if theview is list view then                 set current view of this_item to icon view             else                 set current view of this_item to list view              end if             set current view of this_item to theview         end repeat     end tell      return input end run   edit for el capitan… i've noticed that the finder window refresh no longer works in el capitan, so this is a modified version, quitting the finder instead.  on run {input, parameters}           --toggle invisibles, el capitan version      set newhiddenvisiblesstate to "yes" try     set oldhiddenvisiblesstate to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles"     if oldhiddenvisiblesstate is in {"1", "yes"} then         set newhiddenvisiblesstate to "no"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder appleshowallfiles " &amp; newhiddenvisiblesstate &amp; "; killall finder" end run     i guess you could make it work for the finder only, if you specified some other key command for hide finder - as it is visible as a menu item it would be possible to override for that app alone [by putting something 'useless' as an alternative], leaving you free to then use  cmd ⌘   h  to toggle invisibles from the finder only.  tested - does work this way

boot script  the best thing i can come up with, is a script that will run at boot, and will check whether each apple_hfs type of volume (disk*s*) is mounted
the exact sorting order used by finder probably depends on the locale, but scripting languages like ruby and python have libraries for sorting strings naturally.  #!/usr/bin/env ruby -rubygems -ku  require 'natural_sort' # gem install naturalsort  input = "name-ii-1 name-6 name-2 name-19".lines # input = dir["#{env['home']}/documents/*"]  puts naturalsort.naturalsort(input)

in order to create a time machine backup to an unsupported drive (pretty much anything that's not formatted hfs+) you need to run the following terminal command:  defaults write com.apple.systempreferences tmshowunsupportednetworkvolumes 1   your share will now show up as a valid time machine destination in the time machine preference pane.  time machine will then create a disk image on that drive that will act just like a hfs+ drive for time machines purposes (hard linking, etc.)
thanks to mark for the solution, which was pretty basic, indeed:  open your .bash_profile file in home directory (you can use terminal to open it, or tick "show hidden items" in finder on os x 10.9.4)
no - this general behavior wasn't changed in ios 5 as part of the video / music app split
yes
no - this is a big admin bottleneck if you aren't going to set up a machine to re-share the disk or just share files and back up to the disk so you can have more of a server based permissions and account management toolset.

the general rule is that you cannot boot a device using an os older than the device itself.  so the chances are small.  the trick would be to recreate that drive as the latest os update is announced, concurrently with that product release.  alternatively, use the apple migration assistant  extract:       before you transfer information from a mac, connect the two computers with a cable (ethernet, firewire, or thunderbolt).      note:   if you’re transferring from a mac with os x v10.8 mountain lion or earlier using a thunderbolt cable, follow the steps for transferring from a time machine backup or other disk
since there are a lot of causes - let's try to narrow down some things.  if you are on snow leopard - you can get some more detail on the macbook to know if there is interference or if there is potentially a hardware error.  hold the option (or alt) key and press the wifi icon in the menu (you'll have to add it if it's not in the menu for this testing.)  all the mac cares about is transmit rate - it's the best number to tell how much data your mac thinks it can send reliably to the router

from the top of my head (and without any testing at all):   create a text file with the following content  #!/bin/bash  find "$1" -type l | while read symlink; do     if [ ! -e "$symlink" ]; then         old_path=$(readlink "$symlink")         new_path=${old_path/old drive/new drive}         ln -f -s "$new_path" "$symlink"     fi done  make it executable by running chmod +x name-of-file run ./name-of-file /path/to/search   this is untested so try it with a sample directory first.    to add some explanations   old_path=$(readlink "$symlink") runs the command in $(...) and assigns the result to $old_path ${old_path/old drive/new drive} does text substitution on $old_path  
apple does not provide any public apis for interacting with any of the device radios, and would not approve any app that did so with a private api
assuming your running snow leopard &#x2318;+space will open spotlight which can be used to run terminal.  spotlight can be bound to another key combination but the default is similar to windows+r. 
in your case probably the      mdfind   will do great job.  it is not a gui but a terminal command, and it will search everywhere and everything.  once found you can triple click on the line (to select it) and right click and use the "reveal in finder".

if your friend changed the command that shells are opened with, you can change it back to the default login shell from terminal's preferences:    if the default login shell was changed, you can change it back to /bin/bash by running chsh -s /bin/bash.  zsh is included with os x (in /bin/zsh), but even if your friend installed a newer version of zsh, you don't necessarily need to uninstall or remove it. 
ios does not expose its filesystem to apps, outside their own sandbox

the best solution i use for adding the ssid to the menu bar is turning off apple's menu item and using wifi signal app from adrian granados:   https://www.adriangranados.com/?q=apps/wifi-signal https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi-signal/id525912054?mt=12   it's much fuller featured than just displaying the ssid, but it does that job nicely

yes, it is possible, and great fun!  one way to synchronize apps is using korg's wist technology
to use this (or any) script in a program like apple mail, you could create a service in automator.  launch the automator program.  when it says choose a type for your document, select service and click choose    in the top dialog, select service receives no input in mail.app (or, the name of your program, or any application if that's what you want).  you will insert one action: from the utilities group, double-click run applescript.    select the text that says     (* your script goes here *)   and paste in the script you want to run
system preferences, accounts, login options and tick "show input menu in login window" you'll then be able to change it in the screen saver password window as well  in osx 10.7 lion, "accounts" is "users &amp; groups"
yes, you can change the binary, or even change the info.plist, but like changing the binary you make will need to do this again each time the app is updated

this solution requires f.lux to be installed (i assume it's at /applications/flux.app).  create a text file (let's call it flux-day-color) and put it in /usr/local/bin (usr is under "macintosh hd" and may be hidden).  #!/bin/bash  if [[ ! -z "$1" &amp;&amp; "$1" -ge 2700 &amp;&amp; "$1" -le 6500 ]]; then   defaults write org.herf.flux daycolortemp -int "$1"   killall flux   open /applications/flux.app else   echo "provide a temperature between 2700 and 6500 (rounded to nearest 100)" fi   in terminal, run chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/flux-day-color  now you can run flux-day-color 2700 in terminal (or in another script) to change the day temperature

   how can i keep terminal in foreground while the other apps are being open?   use the -g or --background flag to open:    -g  do not bring the application to the foreground.    for example:  open -g -a notes  will open notes.app in the background.  unfortunately not all apps appear to respect this

what happened could’ve been because of different reasons
according to this thread this is standard for most users
one reason beta software is restricted and considered confidential is that by exposing features could result in revenue recognition issues for the company, which could result in the company refunding money or needing to restate their corporate financials.  lets say you play with the beta, and are extremely excited to discover that this beta has support for left-handed keyboards
three ways come to mind:   run the command as administrator: sudo find / -name "whatever" -print discard all error output: find / -name "whatever" -print 2&gt;/dev/null filter "permission denied" messages: find / -name "whatever" -print 2&gt;&amp;1 | fgrep -v "permission denied"   the key difference between the second and third option is probably that the second discards all error messages while the third will not show any files/folders where the name contains "permission denied" (which is probably highly unlikely).  in addition it may be also worth noting that you shouldn't use the third option if you plan to further process the output of find via a pipe

you can restart while holding down the c key to boot from a valid mac os x install cd / dvd for that g5 based mac
to be able to modify certain directories/files in os x el capitan you have to disable system integrity protection (sip) aka “rootless”:   reboot your mac into recovery mode by restarting your computer and holding down cmd+r until the apple logo appears on your screen. in the menubar click utilities > terminal. in the terminal window, type in csrutil disable. restart your mac. after finishing your mods re-enable it in recovery mode with csrutil enable.     the file /system/library/launchagents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist may be replaced in the next system update. 
if you have an external display, then just closing the lid generally works.  apple calls this "closed clamshell" mode or closed display mode.  but if you only have the macbook, and you want to be able to close the lid without sleep, for instance to move it from one class to another at school without having to use sleep etc, then it's more tricky.  one option it to enable internet sharing in preferences, this requires the os to stay running in case anyone wants to connect, but it does potentially leave you open to unwanted connections.  another way is to run an app like nosleep to do the hard work for you, it's free - check the link.  but there is no simple setting for doing this built into the os. 
here is the code :   tell application "google chrome"     activate      tell window 1 to tell active tab to print     tell application "system events" to tell process "google chrome"         delay 1         tell window "print"             click menu button "pdf"             delay 1             try                 click menu item # of menu of menu button "pdf"             end try         end tell     end tell end tell   just replace the #with the index of your script in the menu
i haven't tested this yet, but softwareupdate seems to support adding ignored updates:  softwareupdate --ignore itunes  --ignore ...             manages the per-machine list of ignored updates.  --reset-ignored             clears the list of all ignored updates.  [...]  sudo softwareupdate --ignore ical iphoto        ignored updates:       (ipod, safariupdate)   this might prevent itunes from getting reinstalled when you upgrade os x:  sudo rm -r /applications/itunes.app touch /applications/itunes.app chflags hidden /applications/itunes.app

the spotlight metadata attributes are not stored in the files, but they are based on other metadata values or properties of the files.   id3 tags can be edited from itunes or with for example mid3v2 from mutagen modification times and creation times can be changed with touch or setfileinfo file flags like kmditemfsisextensionhidden can be edited with chflags kmditemcontenttypetree depends on the filename extension kmditemlogicalsize depends on the size of the file   changes to files are usually reflected in mdls output within a few seconds, but if they are not, try using mdimport. 
i don't know if this is an answer, but i wanted to add some images, so:  first, what computer / os do you use? can you see the photos on this computer? if you are using iphoto or aperture and the photos you are looking for are not visible in these programs, they have already been removed from the icloud server and cannot be re-synced to iphone (at least not through photo stream)

macbooks are designed to be transported around in sleep mode. when the machine enters sleep mode, the hard drive stops spinning, and because the hard drive is basically the only mechanically moving part in the macbook pro (aside from the optical drive which shuts off as well), there is no risk of damage to the computer.  here are some other questions that you may find helpful   does closing the lid put a macbook pro to sleep? would it hurt the computer if i carry it around without shutting it down? transporting from home to work (~10 min by car), should i just make my macbook pro sleep, or shut it completely down first? http://superuser.com/questions/449629/is-sleep-mode-harmful-for-a-computer

 zip -r -x .ds_store directory.zip directory  zip removes extended attributes and acls by default  find directory -name .ds_store -delete; ditto -ck --norsrc directory directory.zip  --norsrc implies --noextattr and --noacl; --noextattr would require --norsrc -c is compress, -k uses pkzip (zip) instead of cpio  copyfile_disable= tar --exclude .ds_store -czf directory.tgz directory  setting copyfile_disable tells tar to remove extended attributes and acls instead of creating ._ files    the files that start with ._ are appledouble files (not resource forks), and they are used to store extended attributes and acls.  extended attributes are used to store the quarantine status of files, the source urls of files downloaded from the internet, information about aliases (aliases stop working if extended attributes are removed), spotlight comments, the encoding of files saved with textedit, and so on.  you can list extended attributes and acls with ls -l@e
i have just discovered that you need to add explicitly use scripting additions to have the display dialog command recognised properly. once you start using use then apparently other libraries, otherwise normally available by default, have to be explicitly included by their own use statements.  so add   use scripting additions   to the client of the library (my first file above) and it will compile and run as intended.

according to this detailed apple support forum post the trick is to use lion 10.7.2 and safari 5.1.1 to force a flush of the data.  simplified steps:   turn off bookmark sync on all devices except the mac backup current bookmarks on mac correct bookmarks on safari on the mac move the new bookmarks out of you safari library folder delete all bookmarks and wait for icloud to update. move the new bookmarks folder back and wait for icloud to update delete all bookmarks on ios devices and re-enable sync.   it's laborious, but i am fairly certain apple will release better tools for this process
with an application such as iexplorer navigate to photodata / misc where you'll find a file called dcim_apple.plist which contains the following:  &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;dcimlastdirectorynumber&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;100&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;dcimlastfilenumber&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;251&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;   the dcimlastfilenumber parameter is quite self explanatory
so far it seems the best way to do it is to run the following bat script (windows 7) periodically:  @echo off setlocal  c: cd \ cd  rmdir /s /q starred  mkdir starred  pushd starred  @for /f "tokens=*" %%a in    (%userprofile%\appdata\local\google\picasa2\db3\starlist.txt) do @(     ::echo %%a     call :get_path "%%a" )  popd  goto last   :get_path :: get file path set _path=%~p1 :: get file name and extension set _name=%~nx1 :: remove trailing backslash from path set _path=%_path:~0,-1% :: trim path call :trim_path "%_path%" if not exist "%_path%\" (mkdir "%_path%") pushd "%_path%" mklink "%_name%" %1 popd goto :eof  :trim_path :: get file name from a path returns the last folder set _path=%~nx1 goto :eof  :last cd pause echo on   this will leave me with a folder full of symlinks (c:\starred\), neatly organized in subfolders, which i will sync with my idevices. 
unfortunately, there is no sidebar icon for the library folder in yosemite and el capitan

mail on os x does actually seem to spawn postfix long enough to deal with the mail, then tear it down a short time later.  to see this in action, try telnet localhost 25 before the mail command, then immediately after, then wait 5 minutes and try it again.  i am not sure this is actually a proper answer to the question because it doesn't explain how postfix is spawned and torn down, but hopefully it helps answer the question. 
the second launchd job ticket format is almost correct
you can do this in the terminal (shell)

after some testing, i believe i have found that one of the best options for this is  installer_user=$(stat -f '%su' $home)   i have found that the $home environmental variable of the user installing the package is passed through, even after elevating for installer.app or using the installer command.  the previous answers are assuming some things about the environment that may not always be true.  for example console_user=$(ps aux | grep console | grep -v grep | cut -d' ' -f1) does not work in there are multiple users logged in, as may be the case in a computer lab environment.  as for ps aux | grep "coreservices/installer" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1;}'; this only works if the user is actually running  installer.app and would not apply to someone running it with the installer command in a shell. 
the os x lion 10.7.5 supplemental update released october 04, 2012 includes:     resolves an issue that may cause time machine backups to take a very long time to complete   and, after testing, this seems to have completely resolved the issue.  note that for me, the first backup after installing this update still took unexpectedly long, and included many com.apple.backupd[423]: waiting for index to be ready (100) messages, so maybe spotlight hadn't yet properly re-indexed the drive
if you use -currenthost with defaults it acts on .plist files in:  $home/library/preferences/byhost/   as an example, i did not have a com.apple.finder plist file at that location and when i executed the following command, one was created at that location.  defaults -currenthost write com.apple.finder gotofield "/foobar"     $ defaults -currenthost read com.apple.finder gotofield /foobar $     note the full file name contains a uuid however you do not need to include it when -currenthost is used, the normal naming is all that's needed as shown in the command line above.  example: $home/library/preferences/byhost/com.apple.finder.6966d045-28dc-544a-97c2-98cdb668dc8b.plist

the only way i have found to eliminate the "other" space on in iphone is to do a full restore, which wipes the device, reinstalls ios, and then allows you to restore from backup.  just click 'restore' in itunes:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201252 
iterm2 will let you remap your modifier keys
there is an environment variable set by iterm and by terminal as the following:  for terminal:  term_program=apple_terminal   for iterm:  term_program=iterm.app   you should see this variable by typing in env from the command line.  so - using this variable, you can put a condition in your .bash_profile file to select the proper coloring. 
the main issue here is that the prompt command and colouring options are sourced from the computer you are logged into

keyremap4macbook  i knew i had seen this somewhere…  all you need to do is install keyremap4macbook.  from the "implicit behavior" section:     share state of modifier keys with all connected keyboards:      when you are using multiple keyboards, modifier keys are shared with all keyboards.      for example, pressing "shift key on keyboard1" and "space key on keyboard2" sends shift-space.   yes, it works on other macs too, not just macbooks.

you need to extend the windows disk size from a running windows.  here is how you do it: http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_us&amp;cmd=displaykc&amp;externalid=1007266  now that you have extended the vmware image size, you need to start at #6 in the link.  edit:  i don't want to write a new answer, and the comment text-box isn't large enough - so here is a more less re-write of the link:  1) extend the vmware image size.  2) attach the hd image to an existing virtual disk of the same os as the resized image (virtual machine libary->[select the vm to use]->settings->hard disks->[click +]->[select the new hd in left menu]->file name->choose existing disk...->[navigate to the resized image, and select the .vmdk]->[choose "share this virtual disk....."]->open->apply) - if you will go the safe way, you'll choose "make a separate copy af the virtual disk" instead of the "share this virtual disk...."  3) start the virtual machine that you just attached the new hd to.  4) now because you are using windows 7, you need to go to "start->computer management->disk manager" and right-click on the partition you need to extend, and select "extend volume".  5) power off (shutdown vm) - and remove the hd attached in #2 - don't delete it...!  6) if you in #2 choose to make a copy of the .vmdk, then you need to replace it manually in the vmware image file (package) - right click on the vmware image (.vmwarevm)->show package contents.  7) power on the virtual machine from #1, and verify the disk size change
essentially you have to make your server accessible behind a router  with a frequently changing ip-adress with a fixed fqdn for the router and forward all http/https requests from the wan to the os x vm in the lan.   set up dynamic dns:   get an arbitrary name from a dynamic dns service provider (like dyn (not free) or no-ip (free))   or depending on your hosting service and the access level you have, set up your own ddns service  set up a ddns client on your os x server set up your os x server vm with a fixed ip set up and check port-forwarding (default is 80/443) on your airport express (some firmware versions seem to be buggy) to the os x server vm. access your home web server  from the internet with the chosen fqdn (e.g

you can create an automator based service that opens the specific preference pane.  you can find the preference pane bundles in the library/preferencepanes set of folders:   /system/library/preferencepanes /library/preferencepanes ~/library/preferencepanes   preference panes are special bundles that when opened from the finder, will launch system preferences.app and automatically switch to their settings.   create an automator service drag the desired preference pane onto the automator workflow add the open finder items action… …and select system preferences.app in the action add a watch me do action to record any clicks and interactions with the panel   to assign this workflow as a keyboard shortcut, see this tuts+ tutorial, how to launch any app with a keyboard shortcut.

the reason to leave 128 mb after each partition is given in an apple's tech note:      note: we leave free space after each partition to make it easier for future system software to manipulate the partition map in ways that we can't anticipate currently.   in reality they adhere to their own policy only in special cases:   formatting a non-system disk to one or more partitions creating a boot camp partition   on a system disk there neither are 128 mb free spaces between partitions (efi – system partition / system partition – recovery hd) nor at the end.

john gruber summarized all sane observations about the iphone lifecycle (part “the iphone product cycle”).  in short, the trend seems to be of two generations support for older devices:   ios5 best on iphone 4s, supported by iphones 4 and 3gs. ios4 best on iphone 4, supported by iphones 3gs and 3g.   apple of course does not have any official policy about that, as for anything that would approach roadmapping.

there are 3 options i can think of, all of which rely on your setup/tools you have
apple's tools for accessing the spotlight index (spotlight itself and the mdfind command) don't offer any regex options, nor do i know of any 3rd party tools that offer that (i'm not actually sure apple has apis that would make that possible).  however the mdfind command does offer a much more powerful interface than the gui spotlight search
from the terminal app you can use the program srm (secure remove). simply start terminal, then type:  srm &lt;filename&gt;   for more info, take a look at the man page. excerpt:     srm  removes  each  specified file by overwriting, renaming, and truncating it before unlinking
look in:  apple menu > about this mac  then click "system report" button  from usb in the sidebar you can see for each device "current available" and "current required" if you plug in a device and it needs more than 500ma then it need an external power source!  if however you are plugging in two and each one requires more than 500ma they will need an external power source!  if this is not the case and each device is 500ma or less you have youre proof!  i think static on the case alone should warrant apple fixing the device.

i solved the problem by making an appointment at the genius bar at the local apple store, explaining what i was trying to do, and asking for their help

the final ios rev for iphone 3g is 4.2.1, and you could always save a backup before upgrading and restor to the 3.x version if 4.2.1 was too much of a hog.  hope this helps!  edit: this thread says its not even worth it
you can suppress the password interface by modifying your mac's authorization rights.  use the built-in security command line tool or authbuddy to change the system.preferences.accessibility right to allow:  sudo security authorizationdb write system.preferences.accessibility allow   opening up the system.preferences.accessibility right will permit any user to change the accessibility settings without a password prompt. 
yes  you can simply copy the application to your applications folder, and then login to the mac application store with the same username and password
go to:  system preferences-> mission control and choose "-" in mission control shortcut   
from apple support:  warning: if you encrypt an iphone backup in itunes and then forget your password, you will not be able to restore from backup and your data will be unrecoverable
assuming you're running the latest ios:  select a playlist

spotlight indexes are updated when a file is written, so results should be available within milliseconds of the write operation being finished.  delays in finding a search result are due to a slow or problematic index or a failure of the scanner to complete that file.  you'll need to diagnose spotlight or perhaps just rebuild your index around the folder if you have problems with the subsystem
i solved this by using handbrake.   select the movie as the source file. near the upper right of the handbrake window, there's an option to select a range of chapters
normally you've to just turn on the 'use ssl' option (preferences->accounts->google->server settings).  it's greyed out, because the option 'automatically find server and port' is enabled
as of mac os x 10.7 lion, terminal has exactly this feature.  if you emit a bell (bel, control-g) in a background tab or window, the terminal application dock icon will show a badge with the number of “unread” bells    and a bell icon is displayed in the tab of the terminal    (if there is only one tab in the window, choose view > show tab bar to see the tab, which also displays other status information.)  this also applies to minimized windows.  when you bring the window to the front or select the background tab, the bell indicator is removed from the tab and the badge count goes down. 
open foo.doc, or open -n foo.doc to force it to open a new window if one is already open for that app. 
well it looks like there are a couple solutions:  option 1. enter this in terminal: defaults write -g applepressandholdenabled -bool false

there is no "good" answer for this, but here's the best i can figure out.  once you are on the call and muted:   make sure you are on the screen that displays the mute/addcall/facetime/contacts buttons (i'll call this the "mute screen" from hereonout) click the top button that turns off and locks the phone when you need to unmute, you can click the on/off or home button and swipe right
os x installers downloaded from the macappstore before february 14, 2016 are no longer functional due to apple's worldwide developer certificate expiration.  during installation you have to set your system's clock prior to that date, with the date command, for example:  date 1111111115    and then install normally your os x lion version on a freshly erased hd  -  to get a functional lion usb installer, just restore (with disk utility) installesd.dmg on a usb stick or burn it on a dvd  the file is inside the app bundle "install mac os x lion.app" -&gt; content -&gt; sharedsupport

since we are talking here of very risky component of the kernel coming from the disk, the first hypothesis to kill is a corrupted file system.   check your boot partition with disk utility.  if errors appear, repair it, and reboot. check for extension problem:  reboot your mac without extensions: os x yosemite: start up in safe mode  if you don't hear the boot chime sound, just press the ⇧ shift 3 seconds after the power on button
i'm running osx under vmware, and as long as you don't run the vm in full screen, display preferences shows the screen size as the current window size, minus any host window borders.  with this you can resize the window manually to get close to the resolution you require.  the caveat to this is that you can't "set" the screen size to an exact amount, but with a bit of playing about you can get the resolution within a few pixels.  you will need a monitor with a larger resolution as the vm window does take away some pixels, so if your monitor is only 1280 wide, you will never get a full 1280 width with this method. 
the core of os x is not garbage collected; iokit's libkern c++ runtime requires developers to manage their own memory.  mac memory management  from how does memory management work in mac os x?     apple documents the lowest levels of the mach kernel and the virtual memory subsystem fairly well on the web as part of it's developer documentation.         kernel programming guide: memory and virtual memory         since that kernel was developed by carnegie mellon university, you can find dozens of papers describing it quite easily.   other sources   wikipedia discusses mac os memory management. apple's support note: use activity monitor to read system memory and determine how much ram is being used   garbage collection  garbage collection exists at the user or application layer

without resorting to using an audio program to normalize the tracks  (which you might eventually have to do if you want to make it “the right way™”), you can select the track(s) you want to lower in itunes and cmd + i to “get info”, go to the options tab and manually reduce the track’s volume.    you can have multiple track selections and the adjustment will apply to all the selected tracks.  i am not 101% sure if this is carried over the iphone/ipad (although it should)
if both system are using the imap mail provider all you have to do is setup the connection to the mail server and all the emails and folders will be copied down to the windows computer
this kind of data is frequently stored in ~/library/application support.  user-specific settings are frequently stored in ~/library/preferences  your chrome profile is located at ~/library/application support/google/chrome/default.  i recommend going on a little exploration of the ~/library folder; there's a lot of useful stuff in there.

ok thanks for your help, but i solved the problem on my way, here's what i've done:   backup everything important to an external harddrive inserted the mac installation disc and ruined there the disc utility app. i removed everything from my hd and it was guid-partioned. now i just installed mac os x 10.6.2 and updated to 10.6.8 now i could run the installer of mac os x lion without any problems and as a benefit of the whole thing, i started with a brand new mac os x installation, without any trash in the file system.  
the apple way is to pick a folder on your pc for sync
for reference, boxcar does exactly what i was looking for and this video has great instructions on how to do the forwarding.

yes, you can get the window id and window title at the same time:  tell application "system events" to get the {title, id} of every window of every process   however, many/most processes are invisible ones, so you'll want to reduce your list:  tell application "system events" to get the {title, id} of every window of (every process whose visible is true)   and further, id is not something set in most windows
the file you are looking for (on el capitan) is located in: /system/library/components/coreaudio.component/contents/sharedsupport/systemsounds/system/  specifically, the file is burn complete.aif (or burn failed.aif, they're identical).  older versions of os x (unknown when it changed) have it at (source): /system/library/components/coreaudio.component/contents/resources/systemsounds/system/ 
for adding functions to itunes you should look at doug;s applescripts

i finally found the solution.  here are the steps to force itunes to add all songs of an apple music playlist to your local itunes “my music” library:   add the apple music playlist to your library by clicking on the + icon on the upper right. go to the playlists tab and select the recently added apple music playlist
got it, there is an option added in the development branch of iterm that adds a "send text at start" option to the profile settings

i had to remove com.apple.ichat and com.apple.messages in ~/library/caches to get it working normally. 
you cannot do this because even if you backed up your atv2, apple recently (or a while ago)  implemented a feature which disables users to downgrade their iphone/ipad/atv2 firmware

take a sip of your tea - it's finished ;)   afaik, you can't bypass it
i found a solution that works for my needs: as it turns out, i should not lock the screen, but instead start the screensaver, and require the screensaver to immediately require a password.  i created a 'start screensaver' service with automator, and then selected a keyboard shortcut for that service under settings->keyboard->shortcuts->services. 
it depends
try applying a combo update  you might try:    download the most recent macosxupdcombo10.7.3.dmg log in as zoomq  prefer british english or british install the combination update restart the computer, you should find 11d50d or greater  run software update until all other updates are installed prefer chinese (simplified) quit system preferences reopen system preferences, retry the preference pane.   background  at os x lion update 10.7.3 (client combo) there is no hint that apple published different downloads with identical names

i found the solution! the three problematic factors were as follows, and these may also apply to other people trying to set up vpn for mac os x server:   i had to ensure that port forwarding was properly set up, as i didn't really see this as an important thing - once the vpn service was working, i disabled the port forwarding for the various vpn ports (500, 1701 and 4500, i think) and it stopped working. i had to use the server's host name on its vpn's config page (server.example.private), but i had to use the external/public ip address (like the one you get from whatsmyip.org) on the client's vpn's config page. don't enter the group name on the client's machine unless you really have to! i entered my group's name, and it didn't work (maybe because i am an administrator as well...)   i hope this helped, at least it's working for me now, and please let me know if you need any more help with any problems that occur while setting up vpn! 
i'm posting this answer from a late 2010 11" macbook air running el capitan, and i have no performance issues
it is very low tech, but some tape is both cheap and effective at holding a cable securely when you start the tape around the cable and then have an inch or two of tape holding the cable securely along the bottom surface of the mac.  choose one with adhesive that cleans with alcohol and most cables and bottom cases are safe for cleaning any adhesive residue that may remain after your session.  i have also seen people use velcro cable wraps with the hook portion affixed to the cable and a loop pad semi-permanently affixed to the bottom of their macbook pro
the explanation on the preferences panel is wrong and confusing
